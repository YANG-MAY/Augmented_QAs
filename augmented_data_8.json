                "context": "Asthma can run in families\nYou\u2019re more likely to develop asthma if it\u2019s in your close family, such as your parents or brothers and sisters. This is partly down to genetics and partly down to the shared environment you live and grow up in.\nIf you have asthma yourself, your child is much more likely to have asthma too, particularly if both parents have asthma. There\u2019s slightly more chance of asthma being passed on by the mother than the father.\nBut having someone with asthma in your close family doesn\u2019t mean you or your child will definitely get it. And people can get asthma without anyone in their family having it.\nAllergies make asthma more likely\nChildren with allergic rhinitis (an itchy or runny nose due to an allergy, like pollen) or eczema, or a family history of allergies, are more likely to develop asthma. Children with a food allergy are said to be four times as likely to have asthma as children without a food allergy.\nSo, if your child is wheezing or coughing, and they also have a history of allergic rhinitis (such as hay fever), eczema, or a food allergy, it\u2019s much more likely that their symptoms are due to asthma.\nSometimes allergies overlap and sometimes your child will grow out of one allergy and develop another. For example, a small child with eczema may go on to have a food allergy, and then, as they get older, hay fever, and then asthma.\nFind out more about how asthma is diagnosed in children.\nBabies born early or small\nA child is more at risk of asthma if they were born prematurely (before 37 weeks), especially if they needed a ventilator to help them breathe after the birth.\nA low birth weight can also be a risk factor for asthma.\nBronchiolitis and croup in babies and young children\nBronchiolitis\nIf your child has had a few episodes of bronchiolitis, they could be more at risk of getting asthma as they get older.\nBronchiolitis is caused by a virus, usually the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It\u2018s mostly babies and young children under two years old who get bronchiolitis. It leads to swelling in the lungs and airways, cough, and wheeze.\nYour baby is more at risk of bronchiolitis if you smoke.\nCroup\nChildren with a history of croup may also be more at risk of developing asthma. Like asthma, croup has symptoms like coughing and feeling breathless.\nSometimes asthma gets missed because parents think it\u2019s croup. But croup is very rare after the age of five, so if your child is still being treated for croup after this age, your GP should check to see if they have asthma.\nExposure to substances at work\nOccupational asthma is a type of asthma caused by certain things found in the workplace, such as chemicals or dust from flour or wood.\nIf you haven\u2019t had asthma before and then get it because of the work you do, and if your symptoms improve when you\u2019re not at work, you probably have occupational asthma. See your GP as soon as possible for advice. If they think there is an occupational cause for your asthma they should refer you to a specialist.\nOccupational asthma is a common cause of adult-onset asthma.\nFind out more about occupational asthma.\nFemale hormones\nHormones can play a part in the development of asthma. After puberty more girls than boys get asthma.\nAnd some women first develop late-onset asthma during or after the menopause. Hormones are a common cause for women developing asthma in later life.\nFind out more about hormones and asthma.\nSmoking\nResearch has shown that smoking during pregnancy and smoking around your baby or child, both significantly increase the risk of a child developing asthma or other breathing problems.\nAnd smoking also has a part to play in adult-onset asthma.\nThe good news is, quitting smoking can really lower your risk of asthma symptoms.\nPollution\nAir pollution, like traffic fumes, can make asthma symptoms worse.\nStudies also show that air pollution may play a part in causing asthma too. For example, children living near very busy roads are more likely to develop asthma.\nJoin our campaign for clean air.\u00a0\nObesity\nBeing obese or very overweight (having a high Body Mass Index or BMI) increases your risk of asthma attacks.\nResearch also suggests a link between excessive weight gain in young children and their risk of developing wheeze and asthma.\nPutting on excess weight during pregnancy is also thought to increase a child\u2019s risk of getting asthma. And babies born with a high birth weight may have an increased risk of asthma.\nFor all of us maintaining a healthy weight is important. If you are very overweight, losing weight can improve asthma symptoms.\nLow levels of vitamin D\nSome studies suggest a link between very low levels of vitamin D and children with wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Good levels of vitamin D during early pregnancy have been found to lower the risk of early wheezing in children.\nIt\u2019s thought that vitamin D deficiency may be adding to the numbers of people with asthma and other allergies.\nYour GP can do a blood test to check your vitamin D levels. If they are low they may suggest supplements.\nFind out more about taking vitamin D.\u00a0\nAntibiotics\nThe widespread use of antibiotics in early childhood and during pregnancy has been linked to an increase in allergies and asthma.\nIt\u2019s thought that antibiotics may be one of the reasons why there are more people with asthma and allergies.\nAntibiotics can be lifesaving, but we can all play a part by making sure we only take antibiotics when necessary. If we do need to take them, it\u2019s important to take them exactly as prescribed. The NHS has more information about using antibiotics safely.\nModern lifestyles and living conditions\nChanges in how we live and work, from more rural to more urban environments, may have a role in causing asthma.\nResearch suggests that we have less contact with the \u2018friendly bacteria\u2019 that thrive in more rural, natural environments. For example, studies show that children growing up on farms, and exposed to \u2018friendly bacteria\u2019, are less likely to develop asthma and allergies. This is sometimes called the \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019.\nNevertheless, \u201cpersonal and home cleanliness is still important,\u201d says Dr Andy Whittamore, Asthma UK\u2019s in-house GP.\nIf you have symptoms like coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, or a tight feeling in your chest, see your GP as soon as possible.",

Certain allergic conditions,\u00a0such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or allergic rhinitis (hay fever),\u00a0are linked to people who get asthma.\n\tViral respiratory infections\u2028Respiratory problems during infancy and childhood can cause wheezing. Some children who experience viral respiratory infections go on to develop chronic asthma.\n\tOccupational exposures\u2028If you have asthma, exposures to certain elements in the workplace can cause asthma symptoms. And, for some people, exposure to certain dusts (industrial or wood dusts), chemical fumes and vapors, and molds can cause asthma to develop for the very first time.\n\tSmoking\u2028Cigarette smoke irritates the airways. Smokers have a high risk of asthma. Those whose mothers smoked during pregnancy or who were exposed to secondhand smoke are also more likely to have asthma. Learn more about the health effects of smoking with asthma\n\tAir Pollution\u2028Exposure to the main component of smog (ozone) raises the risk for asthma. Those who grew up or live in urban areas have a higher risk for asthma.\n\tObesity\u2028Children and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk of asthma. Although the reasons are unclear, some experts point to low-grade inflammation in the body that occurs with extra weight. Obese patients often use more medications, suffer worse symptoms and are less able to control their asthma than patients in a healthy weight range.\n\n",

                "context": "Diagnosing Asthma\nTo diagnose asthma, your doctor will discuss your personal and medical history with you. They will also perform a physical exam. You may need a lung function test (also known as a pulmonary function test), which can be done easily in the clinic. You may need other tests, such as a blood tests or chest and sinus X-ray. If you or your child are having problems breathing on a regular basis, don\u2019t wait! Visit a doctor (or other health care provider like a nurse practitioner) immediately.\nHow Do Doctors Diagnose Asthma?\nPersonal and medical history: Your doctor will ask questions to understand your symptoms and their causes. Bring notes to help you answer your doctor\u2019s questions. Be ready to answer questions about your family history of asthma and allergies, the medicines you take, and your lifestyle. Be ready to share current physical issues, conditions, and concerns. This also includes all previous medical conditions.\nFor example, if you have a history of allergies or eczema, you have a higher chance of having asthma. In addition, a family history of asthma, allergies, or eczema increases your chance of having asthma, too. This information can help your doctor make a diagnosis.\nTell your doctor about any home or work exposure to environmental factors that can worsen asthma. For example, these might include pet dander, pollen, dust mites, mold, cockroaches, and specific foods in some people. Environmental irritants including cleaning chemicals and tobacco smoke can cause asthma.\nThe doctor may also ask if you get chest symptoms when you:\nGet a head cold\nExercise\nUse specific medicines (such as NSAIDs)\nAre under increased amounts of stress\nPhysical exam: Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of asthma or other related conditions. They will look at your ears, eyes, nose, throat, skin, and listen to your chest and lungs. They will measure your height and weight to assess your overall health and use it with your lung function tests. They will also use a device called a pulse oximeter. It goes on your finger and measures the level of oxygen in your blood. You may also need an X-ray of your lungs or sinuses.\nLung function tests:\u00a0To confirm asthma, your doctor may have you take one or more breathing tests known as lung function tests. (These are also called pulmonary function tests.) Lung function tests detect how well you inhale (breathe in) and exhale (breathe out) air from your lungs. These tests measure your breathing.\nLung function tests are often done before and after inhaling a medicine known as a bronchodilator [brahn-ko-DIE-ah-lay-tor]. This medicine opens your airways. If your lung function improves a lot with use of a bronchodilator, you probably have asthma. Your doctor may prescribe a trial with asthma medicine to see if it helps.\nCommon lung function tests used to assess your airways include:\nSpirometry:\u00a0A type of lung function test that measures how much you breathe in and out and how fast you breathe out.\nFeNO test (exhaled nitric oxide):\u00a0A test that helps assess inflammation in the airways.\nBronchial provocation or \u201ctrigger\u201d tests:\u00a0Tests that measure if your lungs are sensitive to certain irritants or triggers.\nAllergy tests:\u00a0A visit with an allergy specialist may be beneficial. Most people with asthma have allergies that trigger or worsen their asthma.\nBlood tests: Your doctor may order blood tests to check your immune system. They will check the levels of a white blood cell called eosinophils and an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). If your levels are high, this may be a sign of severe asthma.",

It also measures how fast you can blow air out.\u00a0\nDuring the test, a technician will ask you to take a deep breath in. Then, you'll blow as hard as you can into a tube connected to a small machine. The machine is called a spirometer. Your healthcare team may have you inhale, or breathe in, medicine that helps open your airways and then blow into the tube again. They can then compare your test results before and after taking the medicine.\u00a0Some people feel lightheaded or tired from the required breathing effort.\nSpirometry with bronchodilator tests\u202f\nThese tests measure how much and how fast air moves in and out both before and after you breathe in a medicine to relax the muscles in your airway.\nBronchoprovocation\u202ftests\u202f\nThese tests measure how your airways react when you breathe in specific substances in the air. During this test, you breathe in allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. How fast the air moves when you breathe in and out is measured before and after the test.\nPeak expiratory flow (PEF) tests\u202f\nPEF tests measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. This test can be done during spirometry or with a small handheld device.\nFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests\nFractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests measure how much nitric oxide is in your breath. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that the airways in your lungs are inflamed, which can make it hard to breathe.\u00a0\u2028For this test, you will breathe out into a tube that is connected to the portable device. It requires steady but not heavy breathing and has few or no risks. It is done in adults and children age 5 and older.\n\nWhat is Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO)Testing?\nThis 2-page fact sheet describes how the test works and when your healthcare provider may use it.\nView the fact sheet\n\nAllergy skin or blood tests\nThese tests can tell your doctor which allergens, such as pet dander or pollen, cause a reaction in your body when you are around these substances.

Monitoring asthma with lung function tests is helpful, because you may not always be able to tell just from your symptoms whether your asthma is under control.\nIn most cases, you have lung function tests in an exam room that contains special devices to measure lung function. A specially trained respiratory therapist or technician is likely to do the tests.\nAsk your doctor if you should do anything to prepare for your lung function tests. For instance, you might need to adjust your medication. You may also need to avoid heavy meals, smoking, and any irritants or other substances that might trigger an asthma attack.\n\n",

People with asthma experience symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus. Common asthma symptoms include:\nCoughing, especially at night\nWheezing\nShortness of breath\nChest tightness, pain, or pressure\n\nStill, not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. You may not have all of these symptoms, or you may have different symptoms at different times. Your asthma symptoms may also vary from one asthma attack to the next, being mild during one and severe during another.\nSome people with asthma may go for extended periods without having any symptoms, interrupted by periodic worsening of their symptoms called asthma attacks. Others might have asthma symptoms every day. In addition, some people may only have asthma during exercise, or asthma with viral infections like colds.\nMild asthma attacks are generally more common. Usually, the airways open up within a few minutes to a few hours. Severe attacks are less common but last longer and require immediate medical help. It is important to recognize and treat even mild asthma symptoms to help you prevent severe episodes and keep asthma under better control.\nKnow the Symptoms of an Asthma Attack\nAn asthma attack is the episode in which bands of muscle surrounding the airways are triggered to tighten. This tightening is called bronchospasm. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed and the cells lining the airways produce more and thicker mucus than normal.\nAll of these factors -- bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production -- cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and difficulty performing normal daily activities. Other symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nSevere wheezing when breathing both in and out\nCoughing that won't stop\nVery rapid breathing\nChest pain or pressure\nTightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\nDifficulty talking\nFeelings of anxiety or panic\nPale, sweaty face\nBlue lips or fingernails\nThe severity of an asthma attack can escalate rapidly, so it's important to treat these asthma symptoms immediately once you recognize them.\nWithout immediate treatment, such as with your asthma inhaler or bronchodilator, your breathing will become more labored. If you use a peak flow meter at this time, the reading will probably be less than 50%. Many asthma action plans suggest\u00a0interventions starting at 80% of normal.",

                "context": "Although we cannot cure asthma, we can control it. Everyone\u2019s asthma is different, so you and your doctor need to create an asthma treatment plan just for you. This plan will include an\u00a0Asthma Action Plan\u00a0that will have information about your\u00a0asthma triggers\u00a0and instructions for taking your medicines.\nAsthma treatments work in these ways:\nThey relax the muscles that tighten around the airways. They \u201crelieve the squeeze.\u201d They can be short- or long-acting. By opening the airways, they help remove and reduce mucus. These medicines are bronchodilators [brahn-ko-DIE-ah-lay-tor] or beta agonists.\nThey reduce the swelling and mucus inside the airways. These medicines are anti-inflammatories (steroidal and non-steroidal).\nBronchodilators\nBronchodilators can be short- or long-acting. If you use short-acting bronchodilators (quick-relief medicines) more than two days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your treatment plan to better control your asthma.\nShort-acting beta agonists (SABA) are quick-relief medicines. They act quickly and should be taken at the first sign of symptoms. They keep the airways open for four to six hours.\nShort-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) are quick-relief medicines that can be taken with a short-acting beta agonist. They act quickly and should be taken at the first sign of symptoms. They keep the airways open for four to six hours.\nLong-acting beta agonists (LABA) are controller medicines. They are not available as a single medicine. They are found in combination medicines that also have an inhaled corticosteroid. They keep the airways open for up to 12 hours. Only one LABA \u2013 formoterol \u2013 also acts quickly.\nLong-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are controller medicines. They are also called anticholinergics and can keep the airways open for 12 to 24 hours. They should be taken daily and will not relieve sudden symptoms.\nTheophylline is a controller medicine that comes as a tablet, capsule, solution, and syrup to take by mouth. It should be taken daily and will not relieve sudden symptoms.\nAnti-Inflammatories (Steroidal)\nAnti-inflammatories (steroidal) come in many different forms. They are also called controllers because they help to control or prevent asthma symptoms. They reduce swelling and extra mucus inside the airways. They will not relieve sudden symptoms.\nInhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are corticosteroids that supplement the natural corticosteroids made by your adrenal glands. They are also called controllers because they help to control or prevent asthma symptoms. They target the airways specifically. They can be taken two ways \u2013 daily or as needed. If you are taking ICS as needed, take it with your quick-relief medicine \u2013 one right after the other. (The FDA has not yet approved these medicines to be used in this way. If you are interested in learning more about this method of treatment, talk with your doctor.) ICS keep working for 12 to 24 hours. Corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids that are taken by some athletes and banned in many athletic events.\nOral corticosteroids are taken in pill or liquid form. This medicine may be prescribed as \u201crescue\u201d for the treatment of asthma attacks that don\u2019t respond to other asthma medicines. They also are used as long-term therapy for some people with severe asthma. Oral corticosteroids have serious long-term side effects compared to inhaled corticosteroids. These can include mood swings, weight gain, high blood pressure, cataracts, osteoporosis, and infections.\nOther Types of Medicines and Treatments\nBiologics are shots or infusions given every few weeks. They work by targeting a cell or protein in your body to prevent airway swelling. They are for moderate-to-severe asthma that is hard to treat with ICS and/or other medicines, or people with asthma dependent on OCS. They are for specific types of asthma and will not work for everyone.\nLeukotriene modifiers are taken in pill form. They prevent your body from making or activating leukotrienes. The FDA has strengthened existing warnings about serious behavior and mood-related changes with montelukast (Singulair\u00ae and generics).\nCromolyn sodium is nebulized. It is a mast cell stabilizer that prevents the release of certain natural chemicals, such as histamines and leukotrienes into the body.\nSingle Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMART)\nThe 2020 Focused Updates to the Asthma Management Guidelines recommends single maintenance and reliever therapy, also known as SMART. SMART uses one inhaler that has two medicines (combination medicine) as a quick-relief and controller medicine. When on SMART, you can either take your medicine only as needed to relieve sudden symptoms, or you can take it daily as a controller and as needed for quick relief. This is based on your age and the severity of your asthma.\nThere is only one long-acting beta agonist \u2013 formoterol \u2013 that also works as a quick-relief medicine. It acts quickly to open the airways and relieve sudden symptoms. It also works as a controller by keeping the airways open for up to 12 hours. The guidelines recommend using the combination of budesonide and formoterol found in SYMBICORT\u00a9. Formoterol is also available with mometasone furoate in Dulera\u00a9.\nThe FDA has not yet approved these medicines to be used in this way. If you are interested in SMART, talk with your doctor.",

These include:\nBronchodilators: These medicines relax the muscles around your airways. The relaxed muscles let the airways move air. They also let mucus move more easily through the airways. These medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma.\nAnti-inflammatory medicines: These medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. They make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. Your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma.\nBiologic therapies for asthma: These are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy.\nYou can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. Your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow.\nWhat is asthma control?\nThe goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. Asthma control means you:\nCan do the things you want to do at work and home.\nHave no (or minimal) asthma symptoms.\nRarely need to use your reliever medicine (rescue inhaler).\nSleep without asthma interrupting your rest.\nHow do you monitor asthma symptoms?\nYou should keep track of your asthma symptom. It\u2019s an important piece of managing the disease. Your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (PF) meter. This device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. It can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. It also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse.\n\n",

                "context": "Starting treatment\nIf you\u2019re having symptoms, and your GP thinks it\u2019s highly likely you have asthma, you may start asthma treatment while you wait for further tests to confirm a diagnosis.\nThis is known as a 'trial of treatment'. You'll be given an asthma preventer inhaler to see if it makes a difference. It may take a few weeks for you to see any benefits. \u00a0\nIf your symptoms improve and asthma is confirmed, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll carry on with these treatments.\nSometimes it can take a while to get a treatment plan that works best for you. You may need to try different inhalers or a different dose.\nYour GP will always start you on the lowest dose possible to get good control and aim to find the best treatment for your asthma.\nAsthma inhalers\nThe most common asthma treatments are inhalers. These are considered the best asthma treatments for most people. This is because inhalers help get the medicine to the airways where it\u2019s needed.\nAlmost everyone with asthma has a preventer inhaler and a reliever inhaler.\nPreventer inhalers\nEveryone with asthma can benefit from a preventer inhaler.\nPreventer inhalers prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. This means you\u2019re less likely to get symptoms if you come across your asthma triggers.\nRegular preventer medicine helps prevent asthma attacks.\nFind out more about preventer inhalers.\nYou need a preventer inhaler if:\n\tyou've noticed symptoms three or more times a week\n\tyou wake up at night with symptoms\n\tyou've had an asthma attack in the last two years\nReliever inhalers\nReliever inhalers relieve asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, and a tight chest.\nYou use your reliever inhaler just when you have symptoms or an asthma attack.\nIf your asthma is well controlled, you shouldn\u2019t need to use your reliever inhaler often - or at all. But remember to always carry it with you in case symptoms do flare up.\nA small number of people who have mild symptoms very infrequently may only need a reliever inhaler to use when they get symptoms.\nHowever, some studies suggest that everyone should have a preventer inhaler too, to lower their risk of asthma attacks.\nFind out more about reliever inhalers.\nIf you're using your reliever inhaler three or more times a week\nsee your GP or asthma nurse as soon as possible to review your treatment plan. If you've only been prescribed a reliever inhaler, see your GP or asthma nurse urgently to ask for a preventer inhaler too.\nAdd-on treatments\nNot everyone needs add-on treatments for their asthma. Most people manage well with a regular preventer inhaler, and a reliever inhaler when needed.\nBut your GP may consider other treatments if you\u2019re taking your preventer inhaler exactly as prescribed, but you\u2019re still having symptoms.\nThese are known as \u2018add-on\u2019 treatments because you take them in addition to your preventer inhaler.\nBefore starting you on any extra medicines, your GP will check whether anything else could be making your asthma harder to manage, such as:\n\tfinding it hard to stick to your treatment plan\n\tnot taking your inhaler in the best way\n\tnot managing to avoid triggers\n\tsmoking, which stops preventer medicine from working as well\nIf you could benefit from extra medicines to help you manage your asthma, your GP may suggest you try one of these add-on treatments:\nLong-acting bronchodilators\u00a0\nA long-acting bronchodilator opens up your airways. It contains reliever medicines that last 12 hours. It can lower your risk of asthma attacks.\nYou must continue to take your preventer inhaler as prescribed because long-acting bronchodilators cannot deal with the inflammation in your airways.\nYour GP may prescribe a long-acting bronchodilator in a combination inhaler. This is one inhaler containing both the long-acting bronchodilator and your preventer medicine. You'll need your usual blue reliever inhaler too, in case you get symptoms.\nA certain type of long-acting bronchodilator medicine, found in MART inhalers (Maintenance and reliever therapy), can give quick relief for asthma symptoms too. This means you can use your MART inhaler as an emergency reliever as well.\nBut not all combination inhalers can be used as a reliever so check with your GP. Make sure your GP or asthma nurse explains what your long-acting bronchodilator can and cannot do.\nMontelukast (Singulair)\u00a0\nMontelukast is a preventer tablet. It is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA). This kind of medicine helps with the inflammation in your airways. \u00a0\nUnlike your preventer inhaler, montelukast does not contain steroids. You need to take it alongside your regular steroid preventer inhaler.\nRead more about montelukast.\nSteroid tablets\nYour GP may prescribe you oral steroids (usually prednisolone) in addition to your usual asthma medicines.\nSteroids help you get symptoms under control in the short term, or if you\u2019ve had an asthma attack, by reducing the inflammation in your airways.\nIf you frequently need oral steroids, or you need to take them long-term, you should be referred to an asthma specialist to look at other ways to manage your asthma.\nRead more about taking long-term steroids. \u00a0\nKeep your blue reliever inhaler handy\nfor quick relief of asthma symptoms. Not all combination inhalers can be used as a quick-acting reliever so check with your GP.\nSpecialist treatments\nIf your symptoms have not improved even though you\u2019re taking your preventer medicines, and any add-on medicines as prescribed, you may be referred to a specialist.\nThe specialist can do tests to work out if you have severe asthma. They can look at options like monoclonal antibody treatments or bronchial thermoplasty.\nTreating asthma attacks\nCall 999 for an ambulance if:\nyou're having an asthma attack and your symptoms do not improve after ten puffs, 30-60 seconds apart, of your reliever inhaler, or if you feel worse at any point.\nIf you do have an asthma attack, the first line of treatment is your blue reliever inhaler. This can quickly get symptoms under control.\nIf you need to be treated in hospital for an asthma attack, you\u2019ll be treated with higher doses of reliever medicine. Sometimes this will be given through a nebuliser. You\u2019ll also be given oxygen.\nYou\u2019ll need to take a course of steroid tablets as part of your recovery plan.\nSee your GP for a follow up after being discharged from hospital. They can make sure you\u2019re making a good recovery, and that you\u2019re not at risk from another attack.\nRemember: taking your preventer medicine every day is the best way to prevent symptoms from building up into an asthma attack.\nFind out what to do in an asthma attack.\u00a0\nIncreasing your treatment dose\nYour GP will probably try you on an add-on treatment before increasing the dose in your usual preventer medicine. This is so you can continue on a low dose of steroid medicine and avoid side effects.\nThey may consider trying a different inhaler device that may be easier for you to use, before increasing the dose.\nIf you\u2019re still having symptoms, even though you\u2019re taking add-on treatments or have tried a new inhaler device, your GP may consider increasing the dose of your preventer. They would start with an increase from a low to a medium dose.\nWhenever your medicines change you should have another appointment with your GP or asthma nurse within four to eight weeks, either in the surgery or over the phone, to see if the change is working well for you.\nAsk your GP or asthma nurse to update your asthma action plan with any changes to your medicines.\nReducing asthma treatments\nAlways talk to your GP or asthma nurse before stopping or reducing any asthma medicines.\nAny reduction in treatments needs to be done slowly and carefully to make sure you\u2019re not more at risk of symptoms and asthma attacks. It may take a few months. \u00a0\nBefore reducing treatments, your GP or asthma nurse will need to consider:\n\tany symptoms and how often you\u2019re having them\n\thow long you\u2019ve been on your current dose\n\tthe benefits of the dose you\u2019re on\n\tany side effects\nYou're more likely to be able to cut down on the medicine you're taking if you've had no symptoms for at least three months.\nGo to regular asthma reviews\nYour asthma review is a chance to talk about how you\u2019re getting on with your asthma. You should go even if you feel well.\nYour GP or asthma nurse can check if you\u2019re on the right treatments to stay well with your asthma.",

                "context": "Medications\nThe right medications for you depend on a number of things \u2014 your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what works best to keep your asthma under control.\nPreventive, long-term control medications reduce the swelling (inflammation) in your airways that leads to symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary.\nLong-term asthma control medications, generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely you'll have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include:\nInhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta).\u2028You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects.\nLeukotriene modifiers. These oral medications \u2014 including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) \u2014 help relieve asthma symptoms.\u2028Montelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions.\nCombination inhalers. These medications \u2014 such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) \u2014 contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid.\nTheophylline. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests.\nQuick-relief (rescue) medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack. They may also be used before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include:\nShort-acting beta agonists. These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex, Xopenex HFA).\u2028Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They're inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.\nAnticholinergic agents. Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) and tiotropium (Spiriva, Spiriva Respimat) act quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. They're mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but can be used to treat asthma.\nOral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications \u2014 which include prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol) \u2014 relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so these drugs are used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms.\nIf you have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away. But you shouldn't need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often if your long-term control medications are working properly.\nKeep a record of how many puffs you use each week. If you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, see your doctor. You probably need to adjust your long-term control medication.\nAllergy medications may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. These include:\nAllergy shots (immunotherapy). Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years.\nBiologics. These medications \u2014 which include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent), reslizumab (Cinqair) and benralizumab (Fasenra) \u2014 are specifically for people who have severe asthma.",

                "context": "How\u00a0asthma is treated\nWhile there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition.\nTreatment is based on two important goals, which are:\nrelieving symptoms\u00a0\npreventing future symptoms and attacks\nFor most people, this will involve the occasional \u2013 or, more commonly, daily \u2013 use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important.\nYou should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so.\n\n\nTreating asthma\nReliever inhalers\nReliever inhalers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually blue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are taken to relieve asthma symptoms quickly.\nThe inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. This allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again.\nReliever inhalers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways, so they do not make asthma better in the long term \u2013 they are intended only for the relief of symptoms.\nExamples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. They are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused.\nHowever, they should rarely, if ever, be necessary if asthma is well controlled, and anyone needing to use them three or more times a week should have their treatment reviewed.\nEveryone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a 'reliever'.\nRead further information:\n\nPreventer inhalers\nPreventer inhalers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually brown, red or orange\u00a0\u2013\u00a0work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring.\nThey must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control.\nYou will need to use the preventer inhaler daily for some time before you gain the full benefit. You may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler to relieve your\u00a0symptoms, but your treatment should be reviewed\u00a0if you continue to need them often.\nThe preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. Examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone.\nPreventer treatment should be taken regularly if you have anything more than occasional symptoms from your asthma, and certainly if you feel the need to use a reliever inhaler more than twice a week.\nSome inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. The use of a spacer device also reduces this risk.\nSmoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers.\nOther treatments and 'add-on' therapy\nLong-acting reliever inhalers\nIf your asthma does not respond to initial treatment, the dose of preventer inhaler you take may be increased in agreement with your healthcare team.\nIf this does not control your asthma symptoms, you may be given an inhaler containing a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist, or LABA) to take as well.\nThese work in the same way as short-acting relievers. Although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. This means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover.\nRegular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. Examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours.\nHowever, like short-acting relievers, long-acting relievers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways. If they are taken without a preventer, this may allow the condition to get worse while masking the symptoms, increasing the chance of a sudden and potentially life-threatening severe asthma attack.\nYou should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself.\nIn view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a 'combination' inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device.\nExamples of combination inhalers include Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair, Flutiform and Relvar. These are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon.\nOther preventer medicines\nIf regular efficient administration of treatment with a preventer and a long-acting reliever still fails to control asthma symptoms, additional medicines may be tried. Two possible alternatives include:\nleukotriene receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways\ntheophyllines \u2013\u00a0tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents\nOral steroids\nIf your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed regular steroid tablets. This treatment is usually monitored by a respiratory specialist (an asthma specialist).\nOral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways:\nto regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped\nwhen long-term control of asthma remains a problem, despite maximal dosages of inhaled and other medications\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in these cases, oral steroids may be given for prolonged periods, or even indefinitely, while maintaining maximum treatment with inhalers as\u00a0this maximises the chance of being able to stop the oral steroids again in the future\nLong-term use of oral steroids has serious possible\u00a0side effects, so they are only used once other treatment options have been tried, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your healthcare team.\nOmalizumab (Xolair)\nOmalizumab, also known as Xolair, is the first of a new category of medication that binds to one of the proteins involved in the immune response and reduces its level in the blood. This lowers the chance of an immune reaction happening and causing an asthma attack.\nIt is licensed for use in adults and children over six years of age with asthma.\nThe National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that omalizumab can be used in people with allergy-related asthma who\u00a0need continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.\nOmalizumab is given as an injection every two to four weeks. It should only be prescribed in a specialist centre. If omalizumab does not control asthma symptoms within 16 weeks, the treatment should be stopped.\n\nBronchial thermoplasty\nBronchial thermoplasty is a relatively new procedure\u00a0that can be used\u00a0in some cases of severe asthma. It works\u00a0by destroying some of the muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs, which can\u00a0reduce their ability to narrow the airways.\nThe procedure is carried out either with sedation or under general anaesthetic. A bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) containing a probe is inserted into the lungs through the mouth or nose\u00a0so it touches the airways.\nThe probe then uses controlled heat to damage the muscles around the airways. Three treatment sessions are usually needed, with at least\u00a0three weeks between each session.\nThere is some evidence to show\u00a0this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma.\nHowever, the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. There is a small risk it will trigger an asthma attack, which sometimes requires hospital admission.\nYou should discuss this procedure fully with your clinician if the treatment is offered.\nRead further information:\n",

                "context": "Asthma Medications\nYou might need to use fast-acting rescue medicines, long-term treatments, or both.\nRescue inhalers (or quick-relief inhalers)\nYou use these medications to ease asthma symptoms. They relax the muscles that tighten around your airways. This helps open them up so you can breathe easier. If you\u2019re using this type of medication more than 2 days a week, see your doctor.\nShort-acting beta-agonists\u00a0are the first choice for quick relief of asthma symptoms. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), epinephrine (Asthmanefrin, Primatene Mist), and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA).\nAnticholinergics\u00a0such as ipratropium (Atrovent) lessen\u00a0mucus\u00a0in addition to opening your airways. They take longer to work than short-acting beta-agonists.\nOral corticosteroids\u00a0such as\u00a0methylprednisolone\u00a0ands prednisone lower swelling in your airways.\nCombination quick-relief medicines\u00a0have both an anticholinergic and a short-acting beta-agonist.\nPreventive long-term medications\nThese treat symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. They reduce swelling and\u00a0mucus\u00a0in your airways so they\u2019re less sensitive and less likely to react to asthma triggers.\nInhaled corticosteroids\u00a0are the most effective long-term control medicines. These aren\u2019t the same as\u00a0anabolic steroids\u00a0that people use to grow muscle. They include beclomethasone (Qvar RediHaler), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), ciclesonide (Alvesco), fluticasone (Flovent HFA), and mometasone (Asmanex Twisthaler).\nInhaled long-acting beta-agonists\u00a0open your airways by relaxing the smooth muscles around them. You\u2019ll take this medication along with an inhaled corticosteroid. They include formoterol, salmeterol, and vilanterol.\nCombination inhaled medicines have an inhaled corticosteroid along with a long-acting beta-agonist. This is an easy way to take them together. They include Advair, Breo, Dulera, and Symbicort.\nBiologics\u00a0target a cell or protein in your body to prevent airway\u00a0inflammation. They may be shots or infusions you get every few weeks. They can be expensive, so you usually get them if other medications don\u2019t work. Biologics include benralizumab (Fasenra), dupilumab (Dupixent), mepolizumab (Nucala), omalizumab (Xolair), and reslizumab (Cinqair).\nLeukotriene modifiers\u00a0relax the smooth muscles around your airways and ease swelling. You can take them as pills or liquids. These include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo).\nCromolyn prevents your airways from swelling when they come into contact with an asthma trigger. It\u2019s a non-steroid\u00a0medicine that comes in an inhaler.\nTheophylline\u00a0(Theo-24, Theo-Dur) relaxes the smooth muscles that narrow your airways. It comes as a tablet, capsule, solution, or syrup.\nTezepelumab-ekko (Tezspire)\u00a0injection is a first-in-class medicine indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.\nLong-acting\u00a0bronchodilators. You might use tiotropium (Spiriva) along with corticosteroids if you have ongoing asthma symptoms even though you take a daily inhaled steroid. Never use long-acting bronchodilators alone as a long-term asthma treatment.\nCorticosteroids.\u00a0If no other medicine can get your asthma attacks under control, your doctor might have you take these medications for a couple of weeks. They come in pills or liquids.\n\nHow Do You Take Asthma Medications?\nAsthma inhalers\nAsthma inhalers are the most common and effective way to deliver\u00a0asthma medicine\u00a0to your lungs. They\u2019re available in several types that work in different ways. Some deliver one medication. Others contain two medications. Your doctor might give you:\nA metered-dose inhaler, which uses a small aerosol canister to push out a short burst of medication through a plastic mouthpiece\nA dry powder inhaler, which releases the medicine only when you take a deep breath\nAsthma nebulizer\nIf you\u2019re having trouble using small inhalers, your doctor may recommend a nebulizer. This machine changes asthma medications from a liquid to a mist so it\u2019s easier to get the medicine into your lungs. It also has a mouthpiece or mask that makes it a good option for infants, small children, older adults, or anyone who has trouble using inhalers with spacers. It takes a few more minutes to use than an inhaler.\n",

Children may outgrow asthma as they get older.\nWhy is my asthma worse at night?\nAsthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. There are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. These include:\nThe way you sleep: Sleeping on your back can result in mucus dripping into your throat or acid reflux coming back up from your stomach. Also, sleeping on your back puts pressure on your chest and lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. However, lying face down or on your side can put pressure on your lungs.\nTriggers in your bedroom and triggers that happen in the evening: You may find your blankets, sheets and pillows have dust mites, mold or pet hair on them. If you\u2019ve been outside in the early evening, you may have brought pollen in with you.\nMedication side effects: Some drugs that treat asthma, such as steroids and montelukast, can affect your sleep.\nAir that\u2019s too hot or too cold: Hot air can cause airways to narrow when you breathe in. Cold air is an asthma trigger for some people.\nLung function changes: Lung function lessens at night as a natural process.\nAsthma is poorly controlled during the day: Symptoms that aren\u2019t controlled during the day won\u2019t be better at night. It\u2019s important to work with your provider to make sure your asthma symptoms are controlled both day and night. Treating nighttime symptoms is very important. Serious asthma attacks, and sometimes deaths, can happen at night.",

But you can also carry medicines to use during an attack, such as a rescue inhaler. Your doctor may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.\n\nQuick-relief medicines\nQuick-relief medicines help prevent or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They may be the only medicines needed for mild asthma or asthma that happens only with physical activity.\nYour doctor will prescribe a quick-relief inhaler for you to carry at all times. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to learn\u202fhow to use your asthma inhaler\u202fcorrectly\nexternal link\n.\nTypes of quick-relief medicines include:\n\tInhaled short-acting beta2-agonists\u202f(SABAs) open the airways so air can flow through them during an asthma attack.\u202fSide effects can include tremors and rapid heartbeat.\n\tOral corticosteroids\u202freduce swelling in your airways caused by severe asthma symptoms.\n\tShort-acting anticholinergics help open the airways quickly. This medicine may be less effective than SABAs, but it is an option for people who may have side effects from SABAs.\nLong-term control medicines\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to take daily to help prevent asthma attacks and control symptoms.\n\tCorticosteroids (steroid hormone medicines) reduce inflammation in the body. They may be taken as a pill or inhaled. The pill form can have more serious side effects than the inhaled form. Over time, high doses can raise your risk of cataracts (clouding of the eye) or osteoporosis. Osteoporosis makes your bones more likely to break. Common side effects from inhaled corticosteroids include a hoarse voice or a mouth infection called thrush.\n\tBiologic medicines may be prescribed for severe asthma. These include medicines such as benralizumab that are injected into a vein or below the skin.\n\tLeukotriene modifiers\u202freduce swelling and keep your airways open. Your doctor may prescribe these pills alone or with steroid medicine.\n\tInhaled mast cell stabilizers,\u202fsuch as cromolyn, help prevent swelling in your airways when you are around allergens or other asthma triggers.\n\tInhaled long-acting bronchodilators, such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), may be added to your inhaler to prevent your airways from narrowing.\n\tAllergy shots, called subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), reduce the body\u2019s response to allergens.\n\nBronchial thermoplasty\nBronchial thermoplasty may help if you have severe asthma and other treatments are not working. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a tube called a bronchoscope into your mouth. The bronchoscope has a camera at the end. Your doctor will guide the bronchoscope into your airways to see inside them. Your doctor will then apply heat to the muscles along the airways. This makes them thinner and helps prevent them from narrowing.\n",

                "context": "For people with asthma, having an asthma management plan is the best way to prevent symptoms. An asthma management plan is something developed by you and your doctor to help you control your asthma, instead of your asthma controlling you.\nAn effective plan should allow you to:\n\nBe active without having asthma symptoms\nFully take part in exercise and sports\nSleep all night, without asthma symptoms\nAttend school or work regularly\nHave the clearest lungs possible\nHave few or no side effects from asthma medicines\nHave no emergency visits or stays in the hospital\nFour Parts of Your Asthma Management Plan:\n1. Know your asthma triggers and minimize contact with them.\u2028Avoiding your triggers is the best way to reduce your need for medicines and to prevent asthma episodes. But first, you have to learn what those triggers are. Any time you have an asthma episode, think about where you were and what you were doing the past day or so. Answer questions like these in a diary or on your calendar:\nWas I making a bed or vacuuming?\nWas I near an animal? Cigarette smoke?\nDid I have a cold or other infection?\nWas I running, playing or exercising?\nWas I upset, excited or tired?\nDiscuss your notes with your doctor to look for trends. As you identify your triggers, talk about which ones you can avoid, and how to best avoid them. For instance, if you are allergic to dust mites, you should put an airtight cover around your pillow and mattress. You may also want to talk with your physician about allergy treatments that may help to prevent allergy symptoms.\n2. Take your asthma medicines as prescribed.\u2028Asthma medicines are usually inhaled through a machine called a nebulizer, through a small device called a metered dose inhaler (also called an inhaler, puffer or MDI) or through a dry powder inhaler (DPI). For inhalers to work well, you must use them correctly. But more than half of all people who use inhalers don\u2019t use them properly. Ask your doctor or nurse to watch you and check your technique. If it is still difficult to use, you have two choices. Ask them to recommend a spacer or holding chamber. This device attaches to the inhaler to make it easier to use and to help more medicine reach the lungs. Everyone can benefit from using a spacer or holding chamber, especially children. Or, ask about using a \u201cbreath-actuated\u201d inhaler, which automatically releases medicine when you inhale.\nUnless your asthma is very mild, chances are you have prescriptions for at least two different medicines. That can be confusing. The more you understand about what those medicines do and why they help, the more likely you are to use them correctly.\nAlthough there are some potential side effects from taking asthma medicines, the benefits of controlling your asthma outweigh this risk. Discuss each of your asthma medications with your doctor to learn more about their effects.\n3. Track your asthma and recognize early signs that it may be getting worse.\u2028Asthma episodes almost never occur without warning. Some people feel early symptoms, including: coughing, chest tightness and/or feeling tired. But keep in mind that because airways to the lungs narrow slowly, you may not feel symptoms until your airways are badly blocked. The key to controlling your asthma is taking your medicine at the earliest possible sign of worsening.\nThere is a simple, pocket-sized device called a peak flow meter that can help detect narrowing in your airways hours, or even days, before you feel symptoms. You simply blow into it, as instructed in your doctor\u2019s office, to monitor your airways the same way you might use a blood pressure cuff to measure high blood pressure or a thermometer to take your temperature. Peak flow meters come in many shapes and styles. Ask your doctor which is right for you. Your doctor may divide your peak flow numbers into zones (green = safe; yellow = caution; red = emergency) and develop a plan with you. Your peak flow number will help you know:\nWhich medicine to take\nHow much to take\nWhen to take it\nWhen to call your doctor\nWhen to seek emergency care\nThe good news is that using your peak flow meter should mean fewer symptoms, fewer calls to the doctor and fewer hospital visits!\n4. Know what to do when your asthma is getting worse.\u2028If you understand your asthma management plan and follow it, you will know exactly what to do in case of an asthma episode or an emergency. If you have any questions at all, ask your doctor.",

In addition to genetics, allergies, illness, smoking, pets, cold air, stress or even exercise can trigger asthma.\nWhat are symptoms of asthma?\nSymptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing or a feeling of tightness in the chest.\nThe lungs react in two different ways:\nMuscle spasms make breathing difficult\nAirways get narrow because the lining of the lungs is inflamed\nHow to avoid common asthma triggers\nAsthma triggers may be different for everyone. Learning how to avoid them can prevent asthma attacks.\nHere are some things you can do to avoid the most common triggers of asthma:\nQuit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke\nWear a mask when painting, doing construction work or yard work\nGet your flu shot\nUse HEPA filters in your vacuum, furnace and air conditioner\nUse protective bedding and pillow cases to reduce allergies\nKeep pets out of your home\nManage stress levels to avoid panic attacks\nSee a specialist to identify allergies and learn how to avoid them\nStay on your prescribed maintenance medicine\nWhat are common medicines or treatments for asthma?\nTreatment and medicines depend on how severe your asthma is and how frequently you have attacks.\nIf you have mild asthma and less than two asthma attacks per week, your doctor may prescribe a rescue or emergency inhaler (bronchodilator) to use as needed for fast relief.\nIf you have more than two asthma attacks per week, your doctor may diagnose you with persistent asthma. They may prescribe a daily medicine like a maintenance inhaler or anti-inflammatory. These prevent asthma symptoms, but may take a few days to start working. It\u2019s also important to keep taking your medicine even if you\u2019re feeling better. \u00a0\nTalk to your doctor if you\u2019re taking your medicine as directed and are avoiding triggers but still have asthma attacks.\nCan breathing exercises help asthma?\nEspecially with stress-induced asthma or asthma symptoms during a panic attack, breathing exercises may help. They give you a tool to calm down while focusing on your breath. Try breathing in and out while slowly counting to ten.",

                "context": "\u00a0While there\u2019s no cure, there are steps you can take to keep your asthma in control and prevent an attack.\n1. Identify Asthma Triggers\nCertain asthma triggers can set off a cascade of asthma symptoms. These include:\nAir pollution\nAllergies\nCold air\nA cold or flu virus\nExercise\nSinusitis\nSmoke\nFragrances\u00a0\nPets\nDust mites\nPests, such as cockroaches\nIt\u2019s vital to learn to identify your asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them.\nKeep track of your symptoms in an asthma diary for several weeks. Detail all the environmental and emotional things that affect your asthma. When you have an asthma attack, check the diary to see which thing, or combination of things, might have led to it. Some common asthma triggers, like molds and cockroaches, aren\u2019t always obvious. Ask your asthma specialist about tests to find the allergens you respond to. Then take steps to avoid them.\n\nIf you have exercise-induced asthma, are planning a heavy workout, or plan to exercise in cold, humid, or dry air, take steps to prevent an asthma attack. Follow your doctor's advice on asthma treatment (usually by using an asthma inhaler containing the drug albuterol\u00a0before you exercise).\u00a0\n\nRegular physical activity is crucial for your overall health, including your lungs. One recent study found that people with asthma who exercised for 30 minutes a day were two and a half times more likely to have control\u00a0over their symptoms, compared with those who didn't exercise at all.\nIf intense running or training is too tough for you, try activities like hiking, biking, and yoga. Swimming can be a great sport for people with asthma, since the warm, moist air around most pools usually doesn\u2019t trigger symptoms.\nKids with asthma need to exercise and play sports, too. Just be sure your child takes their medicine as prescribed and has a quick-relief inhaler nearby at all times.\nWhile food and drinks are not common asthma triggers, some \u2013 like beer, wine, potatoes, dried fruit, and shrimp \u2013 may contain compounds called sulfites\u00a0that can make asthma worse for some people.\u00a0So can some medicines, like aspirin and other pain relievers, or prescription drugs, such as some common high blood pressure meds (beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors). If you take these drugs and think they're affecting your asthma, ask your doctor if there are other options you can try.\n\n\n2. Stay Away From Allergens\nIf you have allergies and asthma, it\u2019s important to keep your distance from allergens (things you\u2019re allergic to). Allergen exposure can increase the inflammation in your airways for a while, making an attack more likely.\n3. Avoid Smoke of Any Type\nSmoke and asthma are a bad mix. Limit exposure to all sources of smoke, including tobacco, incense, candles, fires, and fireworks. Don\u2019t allow smoking in your home or car, and avoid public places that permit it. If you smoke cigarettes, get help to quit. Smoking always makes asthma worse.\n4. Prevent Colds\nDo what you can to stay well. Avoid close contact with people who have a cold or the flu, because catching it will make your asthma symptoms worse. Wash your hands well if you handle items that someone with a respiratory infection may have touched.\n5. Allergy-Proof Your Home\nWhether you\u2019re at home, work, or traveling, there are things you can do to allergy-proof your environment and lower your chances of an asthma attack:\u00a0\nWash your pillow every week in hot water \u2013 at least 130 F \u2013 to kill mites. You can also use cold or warm water with bleach. Wash sheets and blankets every week, too, as well as any stuffed toys your child sleeps with. Use a dehumidifier or an air conditioner to keep the humidity in your home between 30% and 50%, and remove carpet from the bedroom.\nRegular vacuuming can help keep dust mites at bay. But if you have asthma, you may want to ask someone else to do it for you. A vacuum stirs up small particles that can irritate your lungs. So, if possible, stay away while it's happening and for a short\u00a0time afterward.\u00a0\nControl pests in your home. They're often where food is. Try these tips to get rid of them:\nRemove as many water and food sources as you can.\nClean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.\nStore food in airtight containers.\nKeep trash in a closed container.\nVacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice every 2-3 days.\nClean and get rid of clutter on counters, sinks, tables, and floors.\nSeal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.\nUse pesticide baits and traps, but keep them away from children\u00a0\nAvoid using sprays and foggers, as these can trigger asthma attacks.\n\n\nReserve a smoke-free hotel room. If you can, bring your own bedding and pillows in case the hotel only supplies feather pillows and down comforters. They can house dust mites and cause asthma symptoms.\nDon\u2019t eat in restaurants that are smoky or allow cigarette smoking.\u00a0\n\n\n6. Get Your Vaccinations\nGet a flu shot every year to protect against the flu virus, which can worsen your asthma for days or weeks. Asthma makes you more likely to have complications from the flu, like pneumonia, and to be hospitalized because of it. The CDC recommends pneumonia shots PCV15 or PCV20 for adults age 65 or older. Adults ages 19-64 with certain medical conditions or risk factors should also get one. Ask your doctor if you should.\u00a0\nYou also have a higher chance of getting pneumococcal pneumonia, a common type of bacterial pneumonia. And you need a Tdap vaccine to protect you against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, along with a zoster vaccine to keep you safe from shingles.\n\u00a0\n7. Consider Immunotherapy Allergy Shots\nIf your doctor finds that you have allergies, allergy shots (immunotherapy) may help prevent allergy symptoms and keep your asthma from getting worse. With allergy shots, the doctor injects small doses of allergens under your skin on a regular schedule. Over time, your body may get used to the allergen and respond less when you\u2019re exposed. This can help keep your asthma under control.\n\n8. Take Asthma Medications as Prescribed\nLong-term asthma medications are designed to prevent symptoms and attacks. You need to take them every day, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. They\u2019ll ease inflammation in your airways and keep your asthma under control, so it\u2019s less likely to flare up. If side effects bother you, talk to your doctor about switching to another treatment.\n9. Follow Your Asthma Action Plan\nTake your meds, even when you feel OK. Keep an inhaler on you. If you notice symptoms, check your plan for instructions on what medications to take. During an attack, the plan can tell you what meds will help and when it\u2019s time to call the doctor.\n10. Use a Home Peak Flow Meter\nThe meter shows how well air is moving through your lungs. During an attack, your airways narrow. The meter can let you know this is happening hours or days before you have any symptoms. This gives you time to take the medications listed in your treatment plan and possibly stop the attack before it starts.",

It is best to avoid or limit contact with known allergens to decrease or prevent asthma episodes.\nCommon allergens that cause allergic asthma include:\nDust mites\nCockroaches\nPollen\nMolds\nAnimal allergens (pet dander)\nRodents\nLearn more about allergic asthma.\nIrritants in the Air\nIrritants in the environment can also bring on an asthma episode. Although people are not allergic to these items, they can bother inflamed, sensitive airways:\nSmoke from cigarettes and other tobacco or marijuana products\nAir pollution such as smog, ozone, and others\nWood fires\nCharcoal grills\nStrong fumes, vapors or odors (such as paint, gasoline, perfumes and scented soaps)\nDust and particles in the air\nChemicals\nLearn more about air pollution and airborne irritants.\nOther Health Conditions\nCertain comorbid conditions can also compound the symptoms of asthma. (Comorbid means having two or more diseases at the same time.) These include:\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)\nObstructive sleep apnea\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFood allergy and anaphylaxis\u00a0\nFood-induced anaphylaxis (food allergy)\nSulfites in food\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\nHormonal changes during the menstrual cycle or menopause\nObesity\nNasal polyps\nPregnancy\nRespiratory Infections\nColds\nCOVID-19\u00a0\nFlu (influenza)\nPneumonia\nSinusitis or sinus infections\nSore throats\nRhinitis\nLearn more about how other health conditions can affect your asthma.\nExercise or Physical Activity\nExercise and other activities that make you breathe harder can affect your asthma. Exercise \u2013 especially in cold air \u2013 is a frequent asthma trigger. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is triggered by physical activity can can impact people with or without asthma. People used to call it exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Symptoms may not appear until after several minutes of sustained exercise. (If symptoms appear sooner than this, it usually means you need to adjust your treatment.) With proper treatment, you do not need to limit your physical activity. Exercise is important for everyone, including people with asthma!\nLearn more about exercise-induced asthma.\nWeather\nDry wind, cold air, or sudden changes in weather or temperature can sometimes bring on an asthma episode.\nThunderstorm asthma can also affect people with asthma if a thunderstorm hits during high pollen and high humidity. The lightning can hit pollen and break the grains into smaller pieces. Wind from the storm spreads these particles around, making it easier for people to inhale them.\nFeeling and Expressing Strong Emotions\nAnger\nFear\nExcitement\nLaughter\nYelling\nCrying\nWhen you feel strong emotions, your breathing changes \u2013 even if you don\u2019t have asthma. It may cause wheezing or other asthma symptoms in someone with asthma.\nLearn more about how strong emotions cause stress and can worsen asthma.\nMedicines\nSome medicines can also trigger asthma, such as:\nAspirin and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)\nMedicines known as beta blockers \u2013 they can also make asthma harder to control\nTalk to your health care provider about your asthma and your triggers. Be sure to discuss any changes in your asthma management.",

                "context": "Common Asthma Triggers\nIf you have asthma, an asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to \u201casthma triggers.\u201d Your triggers can be very different from those of someone else with asthma. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them. Watch out for an attack when you can\u2019t avoid the triggers. Some of the most common triggers are:\n\nTobacco Smoke\nTobacco smoke is unhealthy for everyone, especially people with asthma. If you have asthma and you smoke, quit smoking.\n\u201cSecondhand smoke\u201d is smoke created by a smoker and breathed in by a second person. Secondhand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. Make your home a smoke-free zone. Encourage household members who smoke to quit. If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you, in your home, in your car, or wherever you may spend a lot of time.\n\nDust Mites\nDust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. If you have asthma and are allergic to dust mites, they can trigger an asthma attack. To prevent attacks:\nUse allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers to make a barrier between dust mites and yourself.\nDon\u2019t use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters.\nWash your bedding weekly and dry it completely.\nVacuum carpets, area rugs, and floors regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.\nKeep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.\n\nOutdoor Air Pollution\nOutdoor air pollution can trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from many sources, including factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke from burning wood or other plants is made up of a mix of harmful gases and small particles. Breathing in too much of this smoke can cause an asthma attack.\nPay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet and check your newspaper to plan your activities for when air pollution levels will be low.\n\nPests (e.g., cockroaches, mice)\nCockroaches and other pests are often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home:\nRemove as many water and food sources as you can.\nClean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.\nStore food in airtight containers.\nKeep trash in a closed container.\nAt least every 2 to 3 days, vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice.\nKeep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean and free of clutter.\nSeal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.\nUse pesticide baits and traps in areas away from children and pets, following manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\nAvoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks.\n\nPets\nFurry pets can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to find a new home for the pet, decrease your exposure by:\nKeeping pets out of bedrooms,\nWashing furry pets,\nUsing an air cleaner with HEPA filter, and\nUsing allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.\nPeople with asthma are not allergic to their pet\u2019s fur, so trimming a pet\u2019s fur will not help your asthma.\n\nMold\nBreathing in mold can trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoor mold growth is often found in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or in areas where water damage has occurred. There are many types of mold which can be found in any climate. Get rid of mold in your home to help control your attacks.\nTo reduce mold exposure in your home:\nDry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth.\nFix water leaks, such as leaky plumbing, which let mold grow behind walls and under floors as soon as you can.\nReplace absorbent materials, such as ceiling tiles and carpet, if mold is present.\nUse an air conditioner or dehumidifier to maintain low indoor humidity.\nGet a small tool called a hygrometer to check humidity levels and keep them as low as you can\u2014no higher than 50%. Humidity levels change over the course of a day, so check the humidity levels more than once a day.\nScrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely.\nEmpty and clean refrigerator and air conditioner drip pans regularly.\nRun the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering.\nTo learn more about mold cleanup in the home after a flood see\u00a0Homeowner\u2019s and Renter\u2019s Guide to Mold Cleanup After Disasters\n\nCleaning and Disinfection\nDisinfectants can trigger an asthma attack. People with asthma should try to stay away when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use.\u00a0Follow these precautions when cleaning or disinfecting places where people with asthma may spend time, such as homes, schools, or workplaces:\nAvoid overuse of products. To help limit your exposure to asthma triggers, follow a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent overuse of products.\nUse safer products. Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack, but you can take steps to reduce the chances of that happening:\nUse soap and water or cleaners certified by the EPA Safer Choice program\u2028to clean surfaces.\nClean visibly dirty surfaces before disinfecting.\nNever mix disinfectant products.\nChoose products for disinfecting that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, such as products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Ensure that products with hydrogen peroxide or ethanol do not contain other chemicals that can cause an asthma attack such as peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid.\nAvoid using bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds in enclosed spaces and limit their use.\nAvoid products with fragrances. The fragrances can trigger asthma attacks.\nMake sure there is enough air flow (ventilation).\nOpen doors and windows to bring in fresh air, if it\u2019s safe to do so.\nImprove ventilation by turning on exhaust fans. Exhausting the air (blowing it outside) is the most effective way to remove disinfectant vapors.\nFor buildings with heating or cooling systems that have fresh (outdoor) air intakes, turn on the fresh air intake to bring in fresh air.\nUsing a high efficiency filter (MERV 13 or higher) with your heating and cooling system can help keep air clean by removing particles such as smoke, pollen, and traffic pollution from the air. Most air filters will not remove disinfectant vapors, though.\nMake sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and to replace the filter as needed. Some systems cannot accept high efficiency filters. In this case, using the highest MERV rating possible will provide the most effective air cleaning.\nUse products safely and correctly.\nAlways follow the instructions on the product label. Do not mix chemical products together.\nWear protective gear such as gloves and goggles.\nSpray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows) to help limit exposure.\nFollow EPA\u2019s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Use\u2028.\nAvoid disturbing dust because it can be an asthma trigger.\nMove away from the trigger (such as the area that was cleaned) if you experience an asthma attack, and follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.\n\nOther Triggers\nInfections linked to influenza (flu), colds, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can trigger an asthma attack. Sinus infections, allergies, pollen, breathing in some chemicals, and acid reflux can also trigger attacks.\nPhysical exercise; some medicines; bad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity; breathing in cold, dry air; and some foods, food additives, and fragrances can also trigger an asthma attack.\nStrong emotions can lead to very fast breathing, called hyperventilation, that can also cause an asthma attack.",

                "context": "What is an asthma trigger?\nAn asthma trigger is anything that can set off your asthma symptoms. Triggers can make your airways more inflamed and can cause asthma attacks. A few things happen when you come into contact with a trigger:\n\tMuscles around the airways tighten.\n\tThe lining of the airways become swollen and inflamed.\n\tSticky mucus can build up in the airways.\n\tThis is what causes your asthma symptoms, such as coughing, breathlessness, chest tightness, or wheezing.\nTriggers can change over time, and some will depend on the time of year, or the environment you\u2019re in. Cold air can affect people in winter, and pollen can affect people in spring and summer.\nOther common triggers include:\n\tcigarette smoke\n\texercise\n\tcolds and viruses\n\tpollution\n\tpet hair\n\tdust mites.\nFind out what else can trigger asthma.\nYou might have one or two triggers, or you may have several. Everyone with asthma has their own set of asthma triggers, and what sets off your symptoms, might not set off someone else\u2019s. It\u2019s important to know what your triggers are so that you can avoid them if possible.\nHow can I tell what triggers my asthma?\nSometimes it\u2019s obvious what your triggers are. For example, your symptoms may come on quickly after coming into contact with a cat or dog, or when you\u2019re around people who are smoking.\nBut it can sometimes be harder to know what\u2019s causing your symptoms. Some triggers aren\u2019t as obvious if they\u2019re not visible, for example pollen or indoor air pollution. And sometimes your reaction might be delayed, or it might build up over a few days.\nIt might help you to keep a diary of activities and symptoms, or keep a record of your peak flow, to help you spot patterns.\nWhy are my reactions to triggers sometimes different?\nYour reactions to triggers may not always be the same. If your airways have been inflamed for a long time, they become more sensitive \u2013 and sensitive airways react more to triggers.\nYou may find your airways are more sensitive when you come into contact with multiple triggers too.\n\u201cYour triggers and the inflammation in your airways can come and go and can be hard to predict. The best way to help stop these causing symptoms making you unwell is to reduce the inflammation by taking your preventer inhaler every day, as prescribed,\u201d says in-house GP, Dr Andrew Whittamore.\nHow to deal with asthma triggers\nAvoiding your triggers\nWrite down the triggers you notice on your asthma action plan. Once you\u2019ve worked out what triggers your asthma, you can start to avoid them if possible. It may also be a good idea to tell your friends and family what your triggers are, so they can help you to avoid them.\nCommon triggers such as cigarette smoke can be avoided by making sure nobody smokes inside your home and other places where you spend time.\nManaging your asthma well\nThere are steps you can take to cut your risk of asthma triggers causing symptoms or an asthma attack:\n\tTake your preventer medicine as prescribed \u2013 this keeps inflammation down in your airways so you\u2019re less likely to react badly to triggers.\n\tUse an asthma action plan to note down your triggers.\n\tGo to your annual asthma reviews to make sure your treatment plan is giving you the best protection against your triggers and cutting your risk of an asthma attack. You can also check your inhaler technique.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to always keep your reliever inhaler with you. This will help you deal with symptoms quickly as soon as they come on.\nFind out more about managing your asthma well.",

They include doing your best to keep your home free of dampness and mold, avoiding air pollution as much as possible, and making a healthy weight a priority for you and your children.\nWhat causes asthma?\nAsthma often starts during childhood when your immune system is still developing. Multiple factors may work together to cause it, such as:\n\tThings in the environment (called allergens) that affected you as a baby or young child, which may include cigarette smoke or certain germs\n\tViral infections that affect breathing\n\tFamily history, such as a parent who has asthma (especially your mother)\nThese can affect how your lung develops or how your body fights germs. Other things that may raise the risk of developing asthma include the following.\n\tAllergies: Asthma is usually a type of allergic reaction. People who have asthma often have other types of allergies, such as food or pollen.\n\tObesity: This condition raises your chances of developing asthma or making your asthma symptoms worse.\n\tRace or ethnicity: African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities are. African American and Hispanic children are more likely than non-Hispanic white Americans to die from asthma-related causes.\n\tSex: More boys than girls have asthma as children, while asthma is more common among women in teens and adults.\n\tOccupational hazards: Breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts in the workplace can raise your risk of developing asthma.\n\nAsthma triggers\nAsthma triggers are things that set off or make asthma symptoms worse. Common triggers for asthma include:\n\tIndoor allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and pet dander or fur\n\tOutdoor allergens, such as pollens and mold\n\tEmotional stress, such as intense anger, crying, or laughing\n\tPhysical activity, although with treatment, you or your child should still be able to be active\n\tInfections,\u00a0such as colds, influenza (flu), or COVID-19\n\tCertain medicines, such as aspirin, which may cause serious breathing problems in people with severe asthma\n\tPoor air quality or very cold air\n",

Other common triggers are irritants in the air, such as smoke or chemical fumes, and strong odors, such as perfume.\nCertain illnesses \u2014 particularly the flu, sinusitis or even a mild upper respiratory infection \u2014 may also trigger an asthma attack, as can strenuous exercise, extreme weather conditions and strong emotions that change normal breathing patterns.\nWarning signs of a potential asthma attack can include an increase in your need\u00a0for rescue medication (especially albuterol), a worsening cough, shortness of breath (particularly if it wakes you up at night) and diminished tolerance for exercise.\n",

In addition, the muscles around the airways tighten and your airways may become clogged with mucus. As a result, your lungs can\u2019t move air in and out efficiently, causing:\nBreathing difficulty\nWheezing\nChest tightness\nBy contrast, the airways are fully open during normal breathing, and air moves in and out with ease.\nTreating an asthma attack\nAsthma treatment typically involves a long-term daily controller(s), plus another rescue inhaler for asthma attacks. These short-acting rescue inhalers can usually stop an asthma attack by relaxing the airways. If the asthma attack is more serious, systemic steroids may be needed to reduce airway inflammation. If necessary, asthma medications and treatment regimens can be adjusted to minimize the number, severity and duration of asthma attacks.\nSome asthma attacks are severe and will require immediate medical attention. If asthma medication is not working and breathing is getting worse, not better, call 911 or go to the emergency department.",

Some examples are listed below:\nAir pollution\u2028Thousands of children under the age of 5 die prematurely each year from lower respiratory infections caused by air pollution from burning fossil fuels. Higher temperatures that come with climate change also promote more ground-level ozone pollution. Ozone is a powerful lung irritant and can trigger asthma attacks.\nAllergies\u2028As the climate warms, the pollen season is getting longer, which can trigger asthma attacks in those children whose asthma can be triggered by allergies. This means that plants that produce pollen, such as ragweed, certain kinds of grass, and trees, are able to release pollen for longer periods of time each year. Many allergenic plants also produce more pollen when they are grown in air that has more carbon dioxide, making the pollen season worse for people with allergies.",

About 80% of people with asthma have allergies.\nRead our advice for coping with hay fever, pet allergies, a dust mite allergy, and other triggers.\n\n\u2018Seasonal\u2019 asthma\n\nSome people have asthma that only flares up at certain times of the year, such as during hay fever season, or when it\u2019s cold.\nWhile asthma is usually a long-term condition, it\u2019s possible to be symptom-free when your triggers aren\u2019t around. \u00a0It\u2019s still important to keep following your asthma action plan and to take your preventer inhaler as prescribed.\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with seasonal asthma, or think you have it, speak to your GP or asthma nurse about the best ways to manage it.\nOur advice can help you cope with seasonal triggers like pollen and the weather.\n\nOccupational asthma\n\nOccupational asthma is asthma caused directly by the work you do. You might have occupational asthma if:\n\tyour asthma symptoms started as an adult and\n\tyour asthma symptoms improve on the days you\u2019re not at work.\nOccupational asthma can be caused by many things. For example, if you work in a bakery, flour dust could trigger symptoms, or if you work in healthcare, latex might be a trigger.\nIf you think you may have occupational asthma, talk to your GP or an asthma nurse so you can get the right help, including referral to a specialist.\nYou can also read our advice on living with occupational asthma. This page also includes information about what your employer should do and what compensation and benefits you may be entitled to.\nOccupational asthma is not the same as asthma that you already have which is made worse by a trigger at work.\nRead our advice on managing asthma at work, and managing triggers such as the indoor environment and workplace stress. You can also speak to your asthma nurse or GP about how to manage any triggers at work. \u00a0\n\nNon-allergic asthma\n\nNon-allergic asthma, also known as non-atopic asthma, is asthma that isn\u2019t related to an allergy trigger like pollen or dust. It\u2019s less common than allergic asthma. Non-allergic asthma often develops later in life. \u00a0\nIf your asthma does not seem to be triggered by things like pollen, dust mites or pets, you might have non-allergic asthma. See your GP or asthma nurse, who can help you find the best way to manage your asthma.\n\n\u2018Exercise-induced\u2019 asthma\n\nAbout 90% of people with asthma have tightening of the airways caused by exercise. \u00a0However, this can also occur in people without asthma.\nIf you don\u2019t have a diagnosis of asthma, but you\u2019re getting symptoms like a tight chest, breathlessness, coughing, or fatigue during or after exercising, see your GP. They can:\n\ttest your lung function with a spirometry test. This is to make sure you don\u2019t have asthma.\u00a0\n\tdo some exercise challenge tests. This is usually on a treadmill or other equipment, and is a way to see how your airways react to exercise. \u00a0\n\tgive you treatments to help with the symptoms you\u2019re getting so you can continue to exercise safely. This might be reliever medicine to take before you exercise.\u00a0\nIf you have asthma and it gets worse during or after exercise, read our advice on exercise as a trigger. Exercise is great way to help you stay well with your lung condition. Find out more about how to enjoy exercise and activities safely.\n\nDifficult asthma\nAbout 17% of people with asthma have what\u2019s known as difficult asthma or difficult-to-control asthma. \u00a0\nYou may have difficult asthma if:\n\tyou get symptoms three or more times a week\u00a0\n\tyou use your reliever inhaler three or more times a week\u00a0\n\tyou wake up at night because of your asthma one or more times a week\u00a0\nIf you have difficult asthma your GP will help you find a combination of asthma medicines that work for you. You might need to see an asthma specialist to work out why your asthma is difficult to control and look at different treatments. \u00a0\n\nSevere asthma\nAbout 4% of people with asthma have what\u2019s known as severe asthma. Severe asthma is usually diagnosed and treated in a specialist asthma clinic. \u00a0\nSevere asthma is a type of difficult asthma that doesn\u2019t respond to the usual treatments. Even if your asthma is described as \u2018difficult\u2019 and you\u2019re having lots of asthma attacks, it doesn\u2019t always mean you have severe asthma. \u00a0\nYour GP may decide to refer you for further assessment and tests if:\n\tyou\u2019re finding your asthma symptoms hard to control, even with prescribed treatments\u00a0\n\tyou\u2019ve had two or more asthma attacks needing oral steroids in a year \u00a0\n\tyou\u2019ve had one or more asthma attacks needing treatment in hospital in a year\u00a0\n\tyou\u2019re using your reliever three or more times a week\u00a0\n\tyou\u2019re on long-term steroids for your asthma\u00a0\n\tyour asthma is affecting day-to-day life or activity levels\u00a0\n\tyou\u2019re waking up at night because of your asthma.\nIf you have severe asthma, you might need different asthma medicines, for example long-term steroid tablets to reduce inflammation in your airways.\nSome people with severe asthma are treated with medicines called biologics. These can help to better control your asthma symptoms and reduce asthma attacks. Read our guide to biologics.\nHaving severe asthma can make life hard. Read our advice to help you get the right support and treatment and feel more confident about managing your severe asthma.\n\n\u2018Brittle\u2019 asthma\nThe old-fashioned term brittle asthma is sometimes still used to describe difficult and severe asthma.\n\nChildhood asthma\nAsthma affects around 1.1 million children in the UK.\nSome children diagnosed with asthma find it improves or disappears completely as they get older. This is known as childhood asthma. \u00a0\nHowever, it can sometimes return later in life.\nIf your child has asthma, read our advice on managing your child's asthma.\n\nAdult onset asthma\nAsthma often starts in childhood, but some people are diagnosed with asthma for the first time when they\u2019re an adult. This is known as adult onset asthma or late onset asthma.\nSome of the possible causes of adult onset asthma are:\n\toccupational asthma: around 1 in 10 cases of adult-onset asthma are occupational\u00a0\n\tsmoking and second-hand smoking\u00a0\n\tobesity\u00a0\n\tfemale hormones: this may be one of the reasons women are more likely than men to develop asthma as adults\u00a0\n\tstressful life events.\u00a0",

They should also take any prescribed medication as a specialist directs.\nThe following tips may also help people with allergic asthma avoid common allergens:\nVacuum and dust regularly in order to remove pet dander, dust mites, and cockroach allergens.\nKeep pets out of bedrooms.\nAvoid outside activities when pollen or air pollution levels are high.\nAvoid foods that trigger allergic reactions, such as milk, eggs, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts, including hazelnuts, walnuts, and almonds.\nReduce the use of harsh chemicals or heavily fragranced products at home.\t\n\n\nNonallergic asthma\nNonallergic, or intrinsic, asthma does not require an allergen to trigger an attack.\nIt is less common than allergic asthma, accounting for around 10\u201333% of all asthma cases. It is more likely to appear in adulthood and affects more females than males.\nExperts believe that nonallergic asthma develops due to genetic and environmental factors.\nFor example, symptoms may occur when a person has exposure to:\ncold\nhumidity\nstress\nexercise\npollution\nirritants in the air, such as smoke\nrespiratory infections, such as a cold, flu, or sinus infection\nTreatment\nPeople with symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing should seek help from an asthma specialist. This will help them determine what is triggering their symptoms. However, it may take longer to work out what is causing nonallergic asthma.\nTo manage their symptoms, they should also take any prescribed medication as a specialist directs.\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal asthma\nIn seasonal asthma, symptoms flare up in certain conditions or at particular times of the year.\nFor example, a person with seasonal asthma may notice that symptoms are worse, or only present, during:\nhay fever season, when pollen levels are at their highest\ncold or hot weather, thunderstorms, and sudden changes in temperature\ndays when air pollution is worse, such as still, cold days\nwinter months, when there are more cold and flu viruses around\nIn many ways, seasonal asthma is similar to allergic asthma. In fact, people may use both terms to describe asthma attacks that occur during the pollen season.\nTreatment\nPeople with seasonal asthma should seek medical treatment. This will help them manage their condition during periods when symptoms are likely to get worse.\nThey should also take any prescribed medication as a doctor or healthcare provider directs.\nThe following tips may also help reduce symptoms of seasonal asthma:\nPay attention to local weather reports on air quality and pollen levels, and only plan outside activities for when conditions are less likely to trigger an asthma attack.\nKeep windows and doors closed, both at home and when traveling by car.\nWear a scarf over the mouth and nose in cold weather, to warm up air as it passes into the lungs.\nKeep medication on hand for quick relief from symptoms.\nKeep a diary to note which weather conditions seem to bring on symptoms.\n\n\nOccupational asthma\nPeople with occupational asthma may find that their symptoms are worse while working, or that they improve with time off work.\nIn fact, up to 15% of asthma cases in the U.S. may be due to job-related exposure to paint chemicals, aerosols, insecticides, or other harmful substances.\nHow long the symptoms take to occur may depend on the level of exposure to these and other substances. Some people may have an asthma attack within 24 hours of exposure. In others, it may take months, or even years, for any symptoms to develop.\nTreatment\nPeople with occupational asthma should seek treatment from a doctor or healthcare provider. This will help them identify what is causing their symptoms, avoid further exposure, and ease their symptoms.\nThey should also take any prescribed medication as a doctor or specialist directs.\nExercise-induced asthma\nExercise-induced asthma occurs when symptoms flare up during or immediately after exercise or another form of strenuous activity. This may happen around 5\u201320 minutes after the exercise.\nAlthough it is common to experience shortness of breath after exercise, exercise-induced asthma may also cause coughing, wheezing, and chest pain, ranging from mild to severe.\nAround 90% of people with asthma also experience exercise-induced asthma, with the majority of cases having a mild form that responds well to treatment.\nThe following factors may also worsen symptoms of exercise-induced asthma:\nchlorinated pools\nexposure to polluted air while running or cycling outside\ncold, dry air while ice skating or playing hockey\nwarm, humid air while doing hot yoga\nTreatment\nAsthma medications can often treat the symptoms effectively. However, it is important for people to see a doctor if their symptoms are not responding to regular medication.\nThe following tips may also help reduce the risk of an asthma attack during or after exercise:\nUse an inhaler before exercise and keep it close to hand when exercising.\nAvoid exercising with a viral infection.\nWarm up before exercise, to help loosen the airways.\nCool down after exercise, to help breathing slow gradually.\nWear a scarf over the nose and mouth when exercising outdoors.\nAvoid exercises that result in labored or heavy breathing.\n\n\n\n\nDifficult-to-control asthma\nAlthough difficult-to-control asthma is not an accepted subtype or diagnosis, some people do find their symptoms much harder to manage.\nSuch symptoms may happen frequently, or the person may be having life threatening asthma attacks.\nThere are a range of reasons that asthma can be difficult to control, including:\nhaving another underlying health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes\nsmoking or frequently being in smoky environments\nnot taking medication correctly, at the right times, or at the correct dosage\nTreatment\nIt is important for people with difficult-to-control asthma to speak to an asthma specialist about their medication and any underlying health conditions or environmental factors they think may be involved.\nA specialist can help the person take their medication in the right way and at the right time. A 2017 study suggests that this can be an effective way to get asthma under control.\nTo discover more evidence-based information and resources for asthma & allergies, visit our dedicated hub.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nSevere asthma\nSevere asthma, or brittle asthma, affects around 4% of all adults with asthma.\nExperts consider asthma to be severe when symptoms do not improve with standard medications. People with severe asthma are likely to:\nhave more asthma attacks than people with mild-to-moderate asthma\nspend more time in the hospital as a result of their asthma\ntake steroid tablets long-term\nThe symptoms of severe asthma are the same as those of mild-to-moderate asthma, but they may be much more intense. They can also sometimes be life threatening.\nTreatment\nTreatment options for severe asthma can vary depending on the symptoms and how a person responds to certain medications.\nIt is important to seek the advice of a specialist, who can help determine which specific treatments are best for each person.\nIn recent years, treatment has advanced for people with severe asthma.\nDoctors are now using monoclonal antibodies to improve the symptoms associated with severe asthma. This type of treatment can also reduce the dosage of steroids that people need to take, potentially leading to a better quality of life.\n",

                "context": "What is allergic asthma?\nFor many people, allergies play a large part in their life. Allergies can affect what you eat, products you use, and even the way you breathe. When allergies combine with a breathing condition called asthma, it\u2019s called allergic asthma. A type of asthma, allergic asthma is a condition where your airways tighten when you breathe in an allergen. This can be something in the air \u2014 often pollen, dander or mold spores. Allergens are also called triggers because they set off your asthma. Things that could cause you to have a reaction, might not affect other people.\nWhen you have allergies your body creates a response to something it thinks is a threat \u2014 the allergen. It fires up all of its defenses to try and fight off danger. This is done by your immune system. Your immune system typically works to protect you from disease. When your immune system thinks that there\u2019s danger, it releases a chemical called immunoglobulin E (IgE). This substance is meant to fight back and protect your body. However, high amounts of IgE can cause your airways to tighten, making it difficult to breathe.\nAsthma is a disease of the lungs that causes your airways to:\nBecome swollen or irritated (called inflammation) specifically in the airway linings.\nProduce large amounts of mucus that is thicker than normal.\nNarrow because the muscles around the airways tighten.\nHow common is allergic asthma?\nMany people with asthma actually have allergic asthma. It\u2019s the most common type of asthma. In the United States, about 25 million people have asthma. Out of that group, approximately 60% have asthma that\u2019s caused by allergies.",

Around 40% of people with asthma experience nocturnal symptoms every night. Having poorly controlled or more severe asthma makes a person more likely to experience nocturnal symptoms.\nThe mechanisms behind asthma symptoms getting worse at night are not fully understood\n\nbut may be related to normal hormonal changes in the evening. Many hormones \u2014 including epinephrine, cortisol, and melatonin \u2014 have circadian patterns, which are 24-hour cycles connected to the body\u2019s internal clock. Changes in these hormones that occur in the evening may contribute to inflammation in the airways, increasing the risk of nocturnal asthma symptoms. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can also affect the symptoms of asthma.\nObesity can also increase the risk of nocturnal asthma and make asthma more difficult to manage. While this link is not fully understood, researchers have hypothesized that excess fat around the throat and increased systemic inflammation may contribute to nocturnal asthma in patients with obesity.\nAcid reflux, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is another medical condition commonly associated with nocturnal asthma. As many as 80% of people with asthma also experience GERD symptoms like heartburn and regurgitation.",

Brittle asthma is very difficult to recognize and to treat. In type 1 brittle asthma, the therapy is based on inhaled and/or oral steroids, and beta2-agonists, used with an inhaler or with subcutaneous infusion.

                "context": "The term \u201cbrittle asthma\u201d was first used in 1977 to describe patients with asthma who maintained a wide variation in peak expiratory flow (PEF) despite high doses of inhaled steroids.1 It was coined at a time when patterns of PEF variability were beginning to be described with respect to clinical patterns of disease, such as the morning dip in PEF1 ,2and the \u201cdouble dip\u201d pattern of morning and evening dips3 seen in patients with less well controlled asthma. The brittle asthmatic PEF pattern of variability was identified as a separate group, being described as chaotic showing no such obvious repeating pattern. The significance of the brittle pattern was not completely clear at that time, although the inference was that these patients had more severe asthma that was, by definition, more difficult to control. Three papers published shortly afterwards showed that this chaotic pattern of PEF could lead to death from an acute severe attack4-6 and the authors raised the possibility that these patients tended to be poorly compliant with treatment. Nevertheless, not all non-compliant patients showed this chaotic pattern, so clearly other factors were important. However, it is not clear how these patients would fit into a classification of severe asthma which would include all those patients at risk of death or repeated hospital admissions.\nSome physicians are unhappy with brittle asthma being classified as a separate asthma phenotype, regarding these patients as simply the severe end of the spectrum. However, it is our belief that definition of differing asthma phenotypes is important, so what follows represents our view that brittle asthma should be considered as a specific asthma phenotype. We suggest how further study of patients of this type may help in unravelling the pathogenesis and treatment of at risk asthma.\nDefinitions\nAfter Turner-Warwick\u2019s initial definition of brittle asthma, the term began to become used in different ways by different physicians and in the first British Thoracic Society Asthma Guidelines7the term was used solely to describe those patients with sudden, severe, life threatening attacks, usually out of the blue. However, studies of asthma deaths have consistently identified PEF variability as a risk factor for death.4-6 ,8 More recently a definition of brittle asthma based on PEF variability, amount of treatment, and repeated attacks has been proposed.9Brittle asthma was defined as a diurnal PEF variability (amplitude % maximum) of >40% for more than 50% of the time (for example, 16 days a month) despite maximal medical treatment\u2014namely, high doses of inhaled corticosteroids with repeated doses of inhaled bronchodilator, often by nebuliser, and maintenance or courses of oral corticosteroids.9 However, it became apparent that this definition of asthma based on PEF variability required scrutiny if it was to be used as a tool for epidemiological studies into severe asthma. The definition itself lacked precision since the phrase \u201cconsiderable medical therapy\u201d did not specify precise doses of treatment such as inhaled steroid dose or use of nebulised bronchodilators. In addition, there was no clear idea of the duration of observation necessary before the label \u201cbrittle asthma\u201d could be applied. Further doubts were cast on a predominantly PEF based definition of brittle asthma when the reliability of PEF meter readings came under question. Recent evidence indicates that several makes of hand held mechanical PEF meters show non-linear inaccuracy in their readings such that they tend to underestimate low and high PEF readings whereas the mid range readings are overestimated.10 ,11 As a result, a prospective evaluation of more than 10\u2009000 patient days of PEF data from patients with severe asthma was undertaken, correcting for PEF meter inaccuracy. A specified dose of inhaled corticosteroid therapy was used\u2014namely, more than 1.5\u2009mg per day beclomethasone or budesonide or more than 0.75\u2009mg inhaled fluticasone propionate daily\u2014and a definite period (150 consecutive days) over which such variability occurred was employed to overcome the transient PEF variability12 seen after acute exacerbations or allergen exposures. Although it is our impression that a period of three months may be an acceptable period over which to assess variability in the clinical context, this tighter case definition is needed for epidemiological work and was used in a series of studies which explored aetiological/risk factors for brittle asthma.\nHowever, this definition does not take into account those patients who are subject to sudden severe life threatening attacks often on a background of apparently good asthma control. Premenstrual asthma may be one such example as some women develop a marked drop in PEF in the few days before menstruation.13 Sometimes these premenstrual exacerbations are so severe that they necessitate ventilation. To allow for this the following classification of brittle asthma is suggested:\n\n\nType 1 brittle asthma: characterised by a maintained wide PEF variability (>40% diurnal variation for >50% of the time over a period of at least 150 days) despite considerable medical therapy including a dose of inhaled steroids of at least 1500\u2009\u03bcg of beclomethasone (or equivalent) (fig 1, lower plot).",

ACOS is not a separate disease, but rather a way for doctors to recognize the mix of symptoms and select a treatment plan that is most appropriate for you.\nSymptoms of ACOS\nPeople diagnosed with ACOS typically experience symptoms more frequently than people with asthma or COPD alone and have reduced lung function. Symptoms include:\n\tDifficulty breathing\n\tExcess mucus (more than usual)\n\tFeeling tired\n\tFrequent coughing\n\tFrequent shortness of breath\n\tWheezing\nIf you have asthma or COPD, it may be difficult to tell the difference between these two chronic lung diseases, especially as people living with asthma or COPD get older or smoke. People with a diagnosis of ACOS tend to have more symptoms than people with either asthma or COPD alone and have more severe attacks, leading to more emergency room visits and hospitalizations. It is important to find out if you have ACOS because it can be more serious than having either asthma or COPD alone. While there is no cure for either disease, your doctor can monitor your health and adjust your medicines to help you breathe better.",

If you have asthma and you smoke, quit smoking.\n\u201cSecondhand smoke\u201d is smoke created by a smoker and breathed in by a second person. Secondhand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. Make your home a smoke-free zone. Encourage household members who smoke to quit. If you have asthma, people should never smoke near you, in your home, in your car, or wherever you may spend a lot of time.\n\nDust Mites\nDust mites are microscopic bugs that are in many homes. If you have asthma and are allergic to dust mites, they can trigger an asthma attack. To prevent attacks:\nUse allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase covers to make a barrier between dust mites and yourself.\nDon\u2019t use down-filled pillows, quilts, or comforters.\nWash your bedding weekly and dry it completely.\nVacuum carpets, area rugs, and floors regularly using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter.\nKeep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.\n\nOutdoor Air Pollution\nOutdoor air pollution can trigger an asthma attack. This pollution can come from many sources, including factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke from burning wood or other plants is made up of a mix of harmful gases and small particles. Breathing in too much of this smoke can cause an asthma attack.\nPay attention to air quality forecasts on radio, television, and the internet and check your newspaper to plan your activities for when air pollution levels will be low.\n\nPests (e.g., cockroaches, mice)\nCockroaches and other pests are often found where food is eaten and crumbs are left behind. To control pests in your home:\nRemove as many water and food sources as you can.\nClean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.\nStore food in airtight containers.\nKeep trash in a closed container.\nAt least every 2 to 3 days, vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice.\nKeep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean and free of clutter.\nSeal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.\nUse pesticide baits and traps in areas away from children and pets, following manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\nAvoid using sprays and foggers as these can cause asthma attacks.\n\nPets\nFurry pets can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. If you think a furry pet may be causing attacks, you may want to find the pet another home. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to find a new home for the pet, decrease your exposure by:\nKeeping pets out of bedrooms,\nWashing furry pets,\nUsing an air cleaner with HEPA filter, and\nUsing allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.\nPeople with asthma are not allergic to their pet\u2019s fur, so trimming a pet\u2019s fur will not help your asthma.\n\nMold\nBreathing in mold can trigger an asthma attack whether or not you are allergic to mold. Indoor mold growth is often found in damp areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and basements, or in areas where water damage has occurred. There are many types of mold which can be found in any climate. Get rid of mold in your home to help control your attacks.\nTo reduce mold exposure in your home:\nDry damp or wet items within 24 to 48 hours to prevent mold growth.\nFix water leaks, such as leaky plumbing, which let mold grow behind walls and under floors as soon as you can.\nReplace absorbent materials, such as ceiling tiles and carpet, if mold is present.\nUse an air conditioner or dehumidifier to maintain low indoor humidity.\nGet a small tool called a hygrometer to check humidity levels and keep them as low as you can\u2014no higher than 50%. Humidity levels change over the course of a day, so check the humidity levels more than once a day.\nScrub mold off hard surfaces with detergent and water. Dry completely.\nEmpty and clean refrigerator and air conditioner drip pans regularly.\nRun the bathroom exhaust fan or open the window when showering.\nTo learn more about mold cleanup in the home after a flood see\u00a0Homeowner\u2019s and Renter\u2019s Guide to Mold Cleanup After Disasters\n\nCleaning and Disinfection\nDisinfectants can trigger an asthma attack. People with asthma should try to stay away when cleaners or disinfectants are being used and right after their use.\u00a0Follow these precautions when cleaning or disinfecting places where people with asthma may spend time, such as homes, schools, or workplaces:\nAvoid overuse of products. To help limit your exposure to asthma triggers, follow a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting to prevent overuse of products.\nUse safer products. Any disinfectant can trigger an asthma attack, but you can take steps to reduce the chances of that happening:\nUse soap and water or cleaners certified by the EPA Safer Choice program\u2028to clean surfaces.\nClean visibly dirty surfaces before disinfecting.\nNever mix disinfectant products.\nChoose products for disinfecting that are less likely to cause an asthma attack, such as products with hydrogen peroxide (no stronger than 3%) or ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Ensure that products with hydrogen peroxide or ethanol do not contain other chemicals that can cause an asthma attack such as peroxyacetic acid or peracetic acid.\nAvoid using bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or quaternary ammonium compounds in enclosed spaces and limit their use.\nAvoid products with fragrances. The fragrances can trigger asthma attacks.\nMake sure there is enough air flow (ventilation).\nOpen doors and windows to bring in fresh air, if it\u2019s safe to do so.\nImprove ventilation by turning on exhaust fans. Exhausting the air (blowing it outside) is the most effective way to remove disinfectant vapors.\nFor buildings with heating or cooling systems that have fresh (outdoor) air intakes, turn on the fresh air intake to bring in fresh air.\nUsing a high efficiency filter (MERV 13 or higher) with your heating and cooling system can help keep air clean by removing particles such as smoke, pollen, and traffic pollution from the air. Most air filters will not remove disinfectant vapors, though.\nMake sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and to replace the filter as needed. Some systems cannot accept high efficiency filters. In this case, using the highest MERV rating possible will provide the most effective air cleaning.\nUse products safely and correctly.\nAlways follow the instructions on the product label. Do not mix chemical products together.\nWear protective gear such as gloves and goggles.\nSpray or pour spray products onto a cleaning cloth or paper towel instead of spraying the product directly onto the cleaning surface (if the product label allows) to help limit exposure.\nFollow EPA\u2019s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Use\u2028.\nAvoid disturbing dust because it can be an asthma trigger.\nMove away from the trigger (such as the area that was cleaned) if you experience an asthma attack, and follow your Asthma Action Plan. Call 911 for medical emergencies.\n\nOther Triggers\nInfections linked to influenza (flu), colds, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can trigger an asthma attack. Sinus infections, allergies, pollen, breathing in some chemicals, and acid reflux can also trigger attacks.\nPhysical exercise; some medicines; bad weather, such as thunderstorms or high humidity; breathing in cold, dry air; and some foods, food additives, and fragrances can also trigger an asthma attack.\nStrong emotions can lead to very fast breathing, called hyperventilation, that can also cause an asthma attack.\n",

                "context": "Common Asthma Triggers\n\u2028An asthma attack usually happens on being exposed to \u201casthma triggers.\u201d Not all people who have asthma have similar triggers. Your triggers can be very different from those of someone else with asthma. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them and reduce the episodes of asthma.\u2028\u2028Some of the most common triggers are mentioned below:\n1. Allergens and Air Pollution\nAllergenic pollens are small enough to be transported by the wind and usually cause allergies. It has been reported that pollens trigger an asthmatic attack in patients who are allergic to them.\u2028\u2028Certain allergies can cause a blood parameter, eosinophils levels, to rise up. About half of people with severe asthma have high levels of eosinophils in the blood, which can cause inflammation and swelling in the airways and other parts of the respiratory system.\u2028\u2028Avoiding pollen is crucial at the time that the offending pollen is airborne. During this duration, follow certain measures like:\nBe outside only early in the morning or during the late afternoon, as humidity is higher in this period and the pollen particles tend to stick and move less in air\nCar and home windows should be kept shut\nWear a mask and wraparound glasses\nTake a shower after being outdoors.\nOutdoor air pollution can trigger an asthma attack which is attributed to several sources, including factories, cars, or wildfire smoke. Alteration in gaseous and particulate outdoor air pollutants can worsen asthmatic symptoms and causes decrease in lung function.\nMonitor air quality around you, and plan your activities accordingly. When air quality index deteriorates, asthmatics should lessen the time spent outdoors and, especially, avoid exertion in the polluted air. Other precautions include wearing a dust mask and taking supplemental antioxidants.\nBesides outdoor pollution, indoor chemical air pollution can also trigger asthmatic attacks. This type of pollution can be reduced by avoiding cooking-related pollutants, limiting the use of sprays and other cleaning materials that produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and by regular air exchange using natural or mechanical ventilation.\n\n2. Heavy Exercise\nExercise and other physical activities, specifically in cold air, make you breathe harder is considered as a common asthma trigger. It has been estimated that a\u00a0heavy workout\u00a0can cause\u00a0airways to narrow in approximately 80% of people with asthma. It is also known as exercise-induced asthma and symptoms include chest tightness and\u00a0cough. You might feel trouble\u00a0breathing within the first 5 to 15 minutes of an aerobic\u00a0workout, which usually gets relieved in the next 30 to 60 minutes of exercise. However, this does not mean you need to limit your physical activity. Talk to your doctor on exercise ways that suit your health best.\n\n3. Weather Changes\nDry wind, cold air or sudden alterations in weather can sometimes trigger an asthma episode.\u00a0Besides cold temperature, increase in temperature can also cause asthma, however, the effect of cold weather appears to last for several weeks, whereas the effect of hot weather is short term.\n\n4. Smoking\nPeople who smoke have a higher probability of getting asthma in comparison to non-smoker and these patients often present with worse symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. Studies have shown that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of wheezing in babies with deteriorated lung function.\nThus, it is essential to quit smoking if you have asthma as even the most effective currently available treatment has reduced efficacy in smokers.\nBesides active smoking, passive smoking is also hazardous as this second-hand smoke can trigger an asthma attack. It is important to encourage your loved ones to stop smoking.\n\n5. Dust Mites\nDust mites are microscopic bugs which can trigger an asthma attack. The gut of these mites contain digestive enzymes, which when excreted in faeces can induce allergies and asthma.\nFollowing measures can be applied to prevent asthma attacks triggered by mites:\nUse allergen-proof mattress and pillowcase in impermeable covers to make a barricade between dust mites and yourself\nWash your bedding weekly in hot cycle mode and dry it completely before use\nMinimize dust accumulating on objects by keeping them in closed cupboards\nVacuum carpets, area rugs, and floors regularly using a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter\nKeep relative humidity levels in the home low, around 30- 50%.\n\n6. Pests\nPests such as cockroaches, rodents are often found in the kitchens where food is prepared and crumbs are left behind. Exposure to cockroach or mouse allergens originating from urine, shed skin cells or hair follicles can trigger asthma.\nThe methods by which pests in your home can be controlled are as follows:\nClean your dishes, crumbs, and spills without any delay\nKeep your kitchen clean and vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice, at least every 2 to 3 days\nStore food in airtight containers\nFrequently dispose of garbage\nKeep counters, sinks, tables, and floors clean and free of clutter\nSeal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing\nUse pesticide baits and traps in areas away from children and pets\nAvoid using sprays and foggers as these can trigger asthma attacks.\n\n7. Pets\nYour furry friends can trigger an asthma attack if you are allergic to them. Decrease your exposure by:\nKeeping pets out of bedrooms,\nWashing furry pets\nUsing an air cleaner with HEPA filter, and\nUsing allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers.\n",

Foods like garlic, cold foods like curd or ice cream or lactose-based products like milk and milk products, fish, junk foods and processed foods can commonly trigger asthma. These foods are harmful particularly for the asthma patient as it may cause some inflammation to the lungs or some infection in the airways, which can cause breathing difficulties,\u201d Dr Namita Nadar, head nutritionist, Fortis Hospital Noida, told indianexpress.com.\n\nPeople suffering from asthma should avoid foods with preservatives as they contain chemicals and have a high sodium content, which can cause allergy and trigger the symptoms, added Dr Nadar.\nAlcohol is a no-no, stressed the nutritionist. Besides inflammation, it may also increase blood pressure levels, and may increase obesity. \u201cMaintaining the Body Mass Index (BMI) is important for an asthma patient.

Though fresh fruit, especially oranges and apples, can help control your asthma, the sulfites that help preserve dried fruit could make the condition worse for some people. Alcohol (especially red wine), shrimp, pickled vegetables, maraschino cherries, and bottled lemon juice also often have sulfites.\n\nMay Hurt: Beans\n5/14\nIt's all about the gas they give some people. It can bloat your belly and make it harder to breathe. It may even trigger an asthma attack. Beans are the most famous candidate. Soak them for a few hours and change the water a couple or so times to lessen this effect. Other gassy culprits are garlic, onions, fried foods, and carbonated drinks.\n\nMay Hurt: Coffee\n6/14\nSalicylates are chemicals that occur naturally in coffee, tea, herbs, spices, and even in anti-inflammatory pills, like aspirin. Though most people don't react to them, they could make it harder to breathe, especially if you already have asthma. You may be able to improve these symptoms if you cut as many as you can from your diet.\n\nMay Hurt: Food Allergies\n9/14\nYou're more likely to have a food allergy if you have asthma. And a food reaction could cause wheezing and other asthma symptoms. In some cases, it's worse if you exercise after you eat certain foods. Try to notice what does it, and avoid it. Typical triggers are nuts, dairy, wheat, and shellfish, though everyone is different.\n\n\nMay Hurt: Too Much Food\n10/14\nWhen you eat more calories than you burn, your body stores the extra in fat cells. You can really start to pack on the pounds if you do that too much. If you become obese (BMI 30 or greater), you're more likely to get asthma and it could make your symptoms worse. In addition, you may not respond as well to typical treatments like inhaled steroids that stop an asthma attack.\n\nMay Hurt: Supplements\n13/14\nAs a general rule, supplements don't work as well as nutrients from food to protect you from asthma. So get your veggies! (And nuts. And fish. And fruit). You may have heard that \"soy isoflavone\" supplements, in particular, can ease asthma symptoms. Some studies suggest that this may be the case for certain people with asthma, but more research is needed.\n\n\nMay Hurt: Liquid Nitrogen\n14/14\nSome people call it \"nitro puff,\" but there are other names. You might notice a stream of smoky coldness that spirals from a fancy cocktail, a new frozen dessert at the mall, or other foods. It may look like fun, but it's best to avoid it. It could cause breathing problems, especially if you have asthma, as well as serious injury to skin and even internal organs.\n",

When you feel strong emotions, your breathing changes \u2013 even if you don\u2019t have asthma. It is not the emotion itself that causes the asthma symptoms. Instead, your breathing changes during strong emotions. This causes muscles to tighten up or your breathing rate to increase.\nSome examples of strong emotions that can trigger asthma symptoms are:\nAnger\nFear\nExcitement\nLaughter\nYelling\nCrying\nLaughing is part of the joy of life and should not be avoided because of asthma.

Wintertime can be a potentially dangerous time of year for many people with asthma.\nTo understand your triggers, picture your bronchial tubes, the airways that carry air to your lungs, as branches on a tree. A person with asthma has a certain amount of inflammation in these airways all the time. Inflammation causes them to narrow and makes it harder for air to get to the lungs. This is why people with asthma have a harder time breathing even if they\u2019re not having a flare-up.\nChanges in weather and fluctuations in temperature are known to inflame airways and trigger asthma flares. For people with bronchial tubes that are already inflamed, the impact of cold weather on breathing can be significant.\nIs asthma triggered by cold air?\nWhen someone with asthma breathes in cold, dry air, it can make the muscles inside start to spasm while also trying to keep airways open. This further irritates the lining of the airways and causes coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.\nCold air can trigger asthma symptoms and flare-ups, especially when there\u2019s dryness in cold air. For many people with asthma, it\u2019s the dryness in cold air that can lead to breathing problems. Cold air accompanied by windy conditions can also trigger symptoms. In general, the more severe your asthma is, the more likely cold air is to affect you.\nWhat are cold weather-induced asthma symptoms?\nCold weather asthma symptoms are no different than asthma caused by other triggers. Asthma symptoms include:\nCoughing, whether dry or with phlegm\nWheezing, especially when breathing out\nShortness of breath\nTightness in your chest",

It can be triggered by multiple factors, including infection, hay fever, allergy or a change in weather. In the UK asthma affects one in every 11 people and one in five households.\n\nThe link between asthma and perfume\nAsthma UK estimates that 2.5 million people in the UK find that fragrances such as perfumes or aerosols trigger their asthma symptoms, likely caused by particles in the air that are breathed in and irritate the airways. This makes them more inflamed and narrow, which can lead to wheezing, coughing, a tight chest, and a potentially life-threatening asthma attack.\n\"Some people with asthma also tell us that strong smells, such as scented candles, hand cream or paint, also trigger their asthma, but the mechanisms behind this are less clear,\" says Sonia Munde, head of Asthma UK's telephone helpline service, which offers support and health advice to people with the condition.\n",

A major development in MDI design was the transition from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) to hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant in the late 1980s.8 CFC canisters contained drug in suspension with propellant, whereas some modern HFA canisters have drug and propellant in solution, offering several advantages over its predecessor. Drug in suspension does not dissolve and therefore requires shaking prior to use, whereas a solution is a homogeneous mixture and does not require shaking. Additionally, the shaking of a device containing drug in suspension does not resuspend drug collected in the metering apparatus. This results in the first actuation delivering less medication than successive actuations.9 Solution-based devices avoid this problem. Finally, actuated drug in solution produces a smaller particle size (i.e. extrafine), resulting in greater lung deposition10,11 and better disease outcomes.12 Table 1 lists some common HFA inhalers in suspension versus solution and the corresponding particle sizes.",

Compared with a pMDI alone, spacers minimise coordination difficulties, reduce oropharyngeal deposition and often increase lung deposition. Spacers may not improve the clinical effect in patients able to use a pMDI properly, but may allow maintenance dosages of bronchodilators and corticosteroids to be reduced. Correct use of spacer devices is important, especially achieving control over electrostatic charge accumulation on the walls of plastic devices. In patients with severe acute asthma or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a pMDI plus large volume spacer may be a viable alternative to a nebuliser for delivering large bronchodilator doses. Although the addition of a spacer to every pMDI would not be justified, the use of large volume spacers has been recommended for any inhaled asthma drug in young children, and as a means of reducing systemic bioavailability of inhaled corticosteroids in adults and children alike.\n",

These plans are usually personalized, according to patients\u2019 clinical characteristics, controller treatments, common triggers, and other factors. AAPs are supposed to facilitate the recognition of exacerbations or declining lung function, and also contain instructions on how to manage or modify, to an extent, the long-term controller therapy in case of worsening clinical manifestations.\nAsthma action plans should be designed to be clear and practical sets of algorithmic instructions, with eye-catching and distinct features to facilitate patient understanding and compliance: they usually employ a three-zone, \u201ctraffic light\u201d scheme, ranging from a green zone (which corresponds to an absence of signs and symptoms, with no need to modify therapy) to a red zone (in which patients are instructed on how to recognize clinical manifestations of generally acute and severe loss of control and to seek immediate medical attention together with the administration of rescue therapy). A yellow zone is usually present as well, corresponding to a progressively declining control and worsening of clinical manifestations, with instructions on how to escalate controller therapy accordingly. This last point seems the more complex and delicate one, and to date, guidelines struggle to give clear-cut and practical indications on how to structure it (10\u201312). A recent work from Kouri et al. (13) gave a valuable tool on how to implement action plans, especially regarding the yellow zone in the adult asthmatic population. Unfortunately, the same attention has not been paid to pediatric AAPs, even though a suboptimal control of asthma in childhood puts patients at risk of long-term complications, as mentioned earlier (5, 8, 9).",

                "context": "Can exercise stop asthma symptoms?\nSome types of exercise can reduce or prevent asthma symptoms. They work by making your lungs stronger without worsening inflammation.\nSpecifically, these activities minimize symptoms because they:\nIncrease endurance. Over time, working out can help your airways build up tolerance to exercise. This makes it easier for your lungs to perform activities that usually make you winded, like walking up stairs.\nReduce inflammation. Though asthma inflames the airways, regular exercise can actually decrease inflammation. It works by reducing inflammatory proteins, which improves how your airways respond to exercise.\nImprove lung capacity. The more you work out, the more your lungs get used to consuming oxygen. This decreases how hard your body must work to breathe on a daily basis.\nStrengthen muscle. When your muscles are strong, the body functions more efficiently during everyday activities.\nImprove cardiovascular fitness. Exercise improves the overall conditioning of the heart, improving blood flow and the delivery of oxygen.\nBreathing exercises\nIn addition to physical activity, certain breathing exercises can also reduce asthma symptoms. These methods help by opening the airways, moving fresh air into the lungs, and reducing the effort of breathing.\nExamples of breathing exercises for asthma include:\ndiaphragmatic breathing\nnasal breathing\npursed lip breathing\nHowever, it\u2019s still important to take your medications as directed. This is the best way to control asthma symptoms, especially during exercise.\n\n\nWhat exercises are best for people with asthma?\nIn general, the best exercises for asthma involve brief bursts of exertion. Gentle, low-intensity activities are also ideal. These exercises don\u2019t overwork your lungs, so they\u2019re less likely to cause asthma symptoms.\nEveryone is different, though. Be sure to consult your doctor and pay attention to your body.\nYou can try:\nSwimming\nSwimming is one of the most recommended exercises for people with asthma. Compared to other activities, it\u2019s less likely to cause asthma-related symptoms due to:\nmoist, warm air\nlow pollen exposure\npressure of fluid on the chest\nDespite these benefits, chlorinated pools can cause symptoms in some individuals. Use caution if you\u2019re new to swimming in pools.\nWalking\nAs a low-intensity activity, walking is another great choice. This form of exercise is gentle on the body, which makes it easier to breathe.\nFor the most comfortable experience, only walk outside when it\u2019s warm. Dry, cool air can trigger or worsen your symptoms. You can also walk on a treadmill or indoor track.\nHiking\nAnother option is to enjoy a gentle hike. Choose a trail that\u2019s relatively flat or has a slow, steady incline.\nIf you have allergies, check the local pollen count before hiking. Only hike if pollen levels are low.\nRecreational biking\nIf you have EIB, try biking at a leisurely pace. This is another gentle activity that doesn\u2019t involve constant exertion.\nYou can also do indoor cycling on a stationary bike.\nShort-distance track and field\nIf you\u2019d like to run, opt for short-distance running activities such as sprints.\nLong-distance running on a track or outside may not be recommended in people with more uncontrolled asthma due to the ongoing effort required.\nSports with short bursts of activity\nThe following sports are appropriate for people with asthma.

                "context": "Which types of exercise are good for asthma?\nPeople with asthma may find that slowly building up their level of exercise reduces the risk of asthma flare-ups during exercise. Types of exercise that focus on promoting lung capacity and regulating breathing can be especially beneficial.\nExercises and activities that offer a person short periods of activity with rest in between can work well. Exercising in this way allows a person to be active and improve their stamina and strength without putting too much strain on the lungs.\nThe following types of exercise may be particularly suitable for people with asthma:\nYoga\nYoga helps a person focus on their breathing. Controlled, rhythmic breathing during exercise can help increase a person\u2019s lung capacity while building muscle strength for overall fitness.\nYoga and rhythmic breathing can also help lower a person\u2019s stress levels. Stress is a trigger for asthma in many people, so reducing stress could help reduce asthma flares.\nSwimming\nSwimming results in the inhalation of warm, damp air, which is good for people with asthma. Swimming can also help with breath control. It can be a gentle activity, and people can work toward doing more intensive sessions as their fitness and lung capacity improve.\nSome people may find that swimming in a pool triggers their asthma symptoms due to the chlorine that is in the water.\nOther forms of exercise\nMany other types of exercise can also help improve the function of the lungs without overstraining them. These include:\ngolf\nbaseball\ntennis\nvolleyball\nbadminton\nweightlifting\nLight-to-moderate exercise also works well, especially when it involves steady movement, which improves endurance levels and avoids overstraining the lungs. Examples include:\nbiking\nwalking\nhiking\nusing an elliptical machine\ntaking the stairs instead of the elevator\nOther more strenuous exercises and activities are not necessarily bad for asthma, but it is best for each individual to talk to a doctor before deciding on the best exercise for them. The doctor can advise on the risks of specific sports, such as running, basketball, or soccer, and how to manage symptoms during these activities.",

Most people who go to PR have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but people with other long-term lung conditions, such as bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis, can also benefit. A PR course typically lasts six to eight weeks, with two sessions of around two hours each week, and includes an individually prescribed exercise and education programme including aerobic exercise and resistance training and lifestyle support.\nPR courses are delivered in groups of 8-16 people and may be held in local hospitals, community halls, leisure centres and health centres. Each course is supported by a PR team made up of trained health care professionals such as physiotherapists, nurses and occupational therapists.\nEvidence shows that accessing PR improves people\u2019s ability to walk further, helps them feel less tired and breathless when carrying out day-to-day activities \u00a090 per cent of patients who complete a PR programme have higher activity and exercise levels, and report an improved quality of life.\nPR has been shown to support better self-management and reduction in exacerbations, reduction in numbers of acute and emergency admissions and reduction in primary care appointments.\nMore information about PR can be found on the British Lung Foundation website and NHS.UK",

                "context": "Seasonal allergens from trees, grasses, and weeds are predominantly derived from air/wind-borne pollen. Even though whole pollen grains are quite large, plants can extrude allergen-containing particles that are less than 10 \u03bcm in size through the pores in their outer covering. This relatively small size likely facilitates entry into the lower airways, and results in the aforementioned allergic cascade with subsequent inflammation. The presence and time of release of these airborne allergens vary according to location and climate. Generally speaking, tree pollen is released first, in the springtime; grasses come later in the spring and early summer; and weed pollen arrives in late summer and early fall lasting until the first frost. Accordingly, pollen-allergic patients can have significant asthma exacerbations during their specific pollen season or seasons. Exposure to seasonal pollens is classically considered an outdoor exposure, with peak outdoor pollen concentrations occurring in the morning. Unfortunately, during the grass pollen season, pollen can be found indoors at high levels in bedding, furniture, and carpeting. This is facilitated by leaving home windows open and using window and attic fans to cool the inside environment.\n\n\nPerennial allergens that trigger asthma include domesticated animals, house-dust mites, and cockroaches. Cat and dog exposures are among the most common causes of perennial asthma triggers; however, all warm-blooded feathered or furry animals, including hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs, and birds can produce allergen. Exposure to these allergens, in turn, may induce IgE-mediated reactions and asthma exacerbations. Pet allergens are ubiquitous in our environment as 30% to 40% of American homes have pets, and even trace amounts of cat or dog allergen can be found in virtually any home (>90%, even in homes without cats or dogs). Acute symptoms may develop in cat- or dog-sensitive asthmatic patients within minutes after entering a home where these animals reside.\n",

Moreover, urban minority children with asthma are exposed to increased environmental triggers5,20 and are found to have poorer adherence to asthma daily controller medications than their non-Latino white counterparts.21 These risks can increase symptoms at home and in school, which may impact learning. To date, the extent to which asthma affects urban children\u2019s academic performance across multiple academic indicators (e.g., absences, grades) is not well documented.\nIn this report, we compare academic performance of a carefully evaluated group of urban children with asthma to their urban counterparts without asthma, and we examine ethnic differences in these associations. Based on previous results showing associations between poorer asthma control and poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration,16 as well as increased absences in urban children with asthma,11,12 we expect those in our study to experience poorer academic performance across indicators compared to their healthy peers. Given the cumulative impact that uncontrolled asthma and urban stressors can have on morbidity and daily functioning,7 we expect urban minority children with asthma to have the poorest academic outcomes relative to minority children without asthma. Within those with asthma, we also examine the association between asthma status (as measured by asthma control, lung function, and daily report of asthma symptoms) and academic performance measured across a four-week monitoring period, as well as ethnic differences in these associations. We expect that poorer asthma will be associated with decrements in academic performance, and that these associations will be moderated by ethnicity. Specifically, we expect the association between poorer asthma and academic performance will be more profound in the ethnic minority children, given it has been shown that morbidity1 and exposure to urban stressors are found to be greater in this group.7\n",

But living with a long-term health condition can also affect your mental health and your ability to cope with daily life.\u00a0\nLiving with a lung condition can have mental and emotional challenges, including:\u00a0\n\tliving in fear of a flare-up or an asthma attack or of not being able to breathe\u00a0\n\tfeeling frustrated when employers, family, or friends don\u2019t understand your condition, or when you feel you\u2019re not always supported or listened to by healthcare professionals\u00a0\n\tworrying about how your lung condition is affecting family, partners, friends, and carers, and feeling unhappy about needing regular treatment and support from others\u00a0\n\tfeeling depressed because it\u2019s hard to do things due to your symptoms\u00a0\n\tfeeling anxious about finances and work, or about the future, and what will happen if your lung condition gets worse\u00a0\n\tdealing with loneliness, because your symptoms mean you miss out on socialising, or because other people don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through\u00a0\n\tfeeling stressed and anxious after spending time in hospital, particularly if time in intensive care has resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder.\u00a0\nA lack of sleep can affect how you feel too. Often people with lung conditions find sleeping difficult, because of symptoms keeping them awake at night. This could be because of other related conditions like obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).\u00a0\nYour mood can also be affected by side effects from your medicines. These side effects can include mood swings.\u00a0\nAn Asthma + Lung UK survey of 3000 people who had taken oral steroids for their asthma showed that 33% reported mental health conditions as a side effect.

Before you\u2028leave, you should arrange to see your GP or asthma nurse for a\u2028check-up. This way, you can feel confident that your condition is\u2028controlled and you won\u2019t need a change of your medication\u2028while abroad. If your asthma is very severe, you may need your GP\u2028or nurse to confirm that you are fit to fly.\nIt is a good idea to take:\n\tcontact details of your GP\n\tyour medical history translated into the language spoken at\u2028your travel destination\n\ta written list of all medications you take\n\tcontact details of a doctor at your holiday destination\nTravel Insurance\nAs usual, you will need to take your medication while\u2028you\u2019re away. It is best to take two inhalers of each kind and\u2028take them in separate bags \u2013 just in case your luggage gets lost or\u2028delayed. This way, you will never be without your inhaler. The same\u2028goes for other essential medications, such as your tablets (if you\u2028take any).\nSome countries have strict rules about importing medication.\u2028Check whether you will be able to enter the country with your\u2028medication to avoid unnecessary stress. In some cases, you may need\u2028to take your prescriptions with you to confirm that the medications\u2028you carry are for your own use\nIf you need an additional inhaler, visit our online doctor\u2028service for an easy way to order your asthma medication online.\nTaking a nebuliser\nIf you are taking a nebuliser with you, you will need to check\u2028the rules of your airline. Some airlines only permit\u2028battery-operated nebulisers to be used on board. Don\u2019t forget\u2028that the sockets at your destination may be different \u2013 you may\u2028need a travel adaptor to connect your nebuliser to the mains when\u2028you arrive.\nImmunisations\nIf you need any vaccines before you travel, let your travel\u2028nurse know that you suffer from asthma. Make sure you mention if\u2028you have recently taken steroids tablets to treat your condition.\u2028Asthma does not usually pose a problem with regards to travel\u2028vaccines or malaria prevention.\nFor more information about travelling with asthma, contact the\u2028Asthma UK helpline on 0800 121 62 44 (the line is open\u2028Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm). You may also find it helpful to take this\u2028number with you, in case you have any questions while you are\u2028abroad.",

If you haven\u2019t seen your doctor recently, it\u2019s worth arranging a review and making sure your self-management plan or asthma action plan is up to date.\nTravelling abroad can take more planning than travelling in the UK, especially if you\u2019re flying. You should give yourself enough time to speak to your doctor before travelling. They will be able to advise you about taking medicine or equipment abroad. If you\u2019re planning to fly, they can also tell you if you\u2019ll need to do a fitness-to-fly (hypoxic challenge) test.\nYour doctor will be able to give you advice about any vaccines you might need before you travel. If you take oral steroids or immunosuppressive medicine, see your doctor at least eight weeks before you plan to leave. You may not be able to have some vaccines, or you may need a vaccine further in advance before going away.\nYou can find more information and advice on the NHS Fitfortravel website.\nWhat to consider when planning a trip\nWhen you\u2019re planning a trip, it\u2019s good to think about things like:\nWeather\nVery warm or cold weather can affect you and lead to flare-ups or an asthma attack. Hot weather also increases the amount of ozone in the air, which can make symptoms worse.\u00a0\nWeather changes like heat, cold, humidity or thunderstorms can make symptoms of lung conditions worse. For some people with asthma, they can trigger attacks.\u00a0\nWe have more advice about keeping your lungs healthy in hot weather and cold weather, and about weather as an asthma trigger.\nPollution\nAir pollution is harmful to everyone, but people with lung conditions are more at risk.\nPollutants can irritate your lungs and trigger symptoms, so you may want to consider the air quality at your destination.\nYou can find information about air quality in the UK on the Defra website. You can check the air quality of locations around the world on the World Air Quality Index website.\nHigh altitude\nYour lungs get less oxygen at high altitude, for example in mountainous areas. This can make it more difficult for people with lung conditions, so it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor before travelling.\nFor some conditions, your doctor may suggest you have a test to see if you should use oxygen while at high altitude. If you already use oxygen, they may suggest you increase your flow rate.\nPollen\nPollen can trigger symptoms for some people with lung conditions. Some people find they actually get fewer symptoms from pollen when abroad, because they\u2019re not allergic to some native trees and grasses in the way they are in the UK.\u00a0\nYou still might want to avoid going to countries that have high pollen levels, especially during their pollen season. There are plenty of destinations that have lower pollen levels. Areas by the coast also tend to have lower pollen counts.\nAccommodation\nIf your condition is triggered by things like cigarette smoke, pets or dust mites, you should check whether these could be a problem at your accommodation. If you cannot avoid a trigger, make sure you follow your treatment plan and take your medicines as prescribed to lower your risk of symptoms.",

Honest communication\nIf you enter into a new relationship, discuss your asthma with your new partner. Although talking about sex (or having sex!) with a new partner can already be awkward, it is important that you bring up your asthma! If you begin to flare up or have an asthma attack during sex, your new partner might have no idea what is going on, or what to do.2\n\n2. Know your triggers\nIf you have exercise-induced asthma, then it may be more likely that you feel asthma symptoms during sex. Sex and intimacy can increase heart rate, change the rate of your breath, and evoke strong emotions; all of which can trigger an asthma attack!\nAdditionally, pay attention to your environment. Is there dust in the bedroom? Are there animals around? Is your partner wearing strong perfume or cologne?2\n3. Know that you are not alone\nAs previously demonstrated by the survey statistic, many other people feel as if their asthma affects their sex life. Understand that everyone is self-conscious about SOMETHING, and your \"something\" might be asthma. It may feel alienating to know that your asthma affects your sex life, but my guess is that you will feel much better if you talk about it.\n\n4. Manage your asthma\nIf your asthma is well-managed, then intimacy and sex should be less affected by your asthma. If your asthma flares up every time you try to get intimate with your partner, then this could be a sign that your asthma is not well managed.",

Chronic cough or phlegm and having a high BMI significantly increased the individual total cost [14].\nIn Fig.\u00a01 we present an estimate of the annual asthma cost per patient in Europe using the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) technique to make comparisons among costs in countries with different Gross National Product (GNP) and different prices on human resources, drugs and hospitalizations [33].\n\nWithin the direct costs, in some regions, like USA and several countries from Central/South America and Southeast Asia, the expenses with hospital inpatient care represent the major component [1, 22, 25]. Nevertheless, in Europe and Korea it is the outpatient medication and human resources that are responsible for most of the direct costs [10, 28, 34, 35].\nIn USA 2012 data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), found that, annually, 20% of asthmatics, from those who need emergency service visits, have at least one hospital admission with an average of 3.6\u00a0days of hospitalization [23].\nRegarding asthma-related hospitalizations, children and adolescents have a prevalence that is at least twice that of adults. In children aged 0\u20134 years, asthma-related hospitalizations are particularly frequent. Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood and one of the main causes of hospitalizations [2].\nThe expenses related to hospital inpatient care are variable. Some studies have found higher costs in private versus public or non-profit hospitals. However, the difference is only around 20 to 30% of the cost [36\u201339].\nIn the last decade, many generic drugs to treat asthma become available, which were cheaper than brand drugs. In Europe, the prices of inhaled steroids (combined or not with long-acting bronchodilators) are variable from country to country. Most patients with persistent asthma need daily medication, have yearly differences in total medication cost among European countries.\nHuman resources and complementary expenses in outpatient settings, such as offices, clinics or hospital ambulatory, usually contribute from 50 to 65% of total direct costs. This percentage depends on the health system, public versus private and insurance coverage.\nIn Europe, for instance, there are several types of health public facility organization. We can divide them into 2 strategies: one related to \u201creliance on market mechanisms in service provision\u201d and another in \u201cmostly public provision and public insurance\u201d. The interaction with patient payment and/or reimbursement makes a significant difference on the total direct cost supported by asthma patients and their families [40].",

                "context": "1. Beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E\nBeing overweight or having obesity increases your risk\nTrusted Source\nfor asthma and can worsen your symptoms. It\u2019s important to maintain a balanced diet including plenty of fruits and vegetables.\nThese foods are good sources of antioxidants like beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, which may help reduce\nTrusted Source\ninflammation around your airways.\nHowever, if you experience a flare-up in asthma symptoms after eating certain foods, try to avoid them. You may have a food allergy that\u2019s causing your symptoms to worsen. Talk with your doctor to confirm this.\n2. The gut microbiome\nResearch\nTrusted Source\nsuggests that asthma may be linked to our gut microbiome. This means asthma symptoms may worsen if there\u2019s an imbalance of beneficial bacteria in your gut.\nConsuming probiotics may help reduce inflammation. In a 2021 study, researchers found that combining probiotics with regular asthma treatment improved symptoms.\nSources of probiotics include fermented foods such as:\nyogurt or kefir\nsauerkraut\ntempeh\nkimchi\nmiso\nkombucha\nIn addition some cheeses contain probiotics, and you can also take probiotic supplements, though getting them from your diet may be preferable.\n3. Garlic\nGarlic has several health benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, according to research. Because asthma is an inflammatory disease, garlic may be able to help relieve your symptoms.\nA 2019 study\nTrusted Source\nfound that garlic extracts significantly reduced the number of inflammatory cells and white blood cells called iosinophils in laboratory mice. This, in turn, seemed to decrease bronchial inflammation.\nStill, there\u2019s no conclusive evidence that garlic is effective against preventing asthma flare-ups.\n4. Ginger\nGinger is another herb that contains anti-inflammatory properties and may help with severe asthma. In particular, it contains a compound called 6-gingerol, which has been shown to decrease\nTrusted Source\nallergic lung inflammation in studies on mice.\nThese studies were specifically focused on lung inflammation induced by a dust mite allergy, which can be an asthma trigger.\nStudies also suggest that ginger may help relax the trachea and airway muscles, as well as reduce mechanical ventilation time for people with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). That said, a clinical trial on ginger and asthma in human subjects is still ongoing.\n5. Honey\nHoney is frequently used in cold remedies to help soothe the throat and reduce coughing. You can mix honey with a hot beverage like herbal tea to help relieve your symptoms.\nAccording to a 2019 study\nTrusted Source\n, honey was found to help improve breathing and lung function in people with asthma, but only when combined with other remedies such as cumin. The research did not find evidence for the effectiveness of honey on its own.\nOther scientific evidence that honey should be used as an alternative asthma treatment is limited\nTrusted Source\n.\n6. Omega-3 oils\nOmega-3 oils, which can be found in fish and flax seeds, have been shown to have many health benefits. They are also associated with decreased airway inflammation, which may help improve lung function in people with severe asthma.\nHowever, research also shows that people taking high doses of oral steroids to treat their asthma symptoms may not see as much benefit from consuming omega-3 through food or fish oil supplements.\nThis is because steroids block the beneficial effects of omega-3 oils. It\u2019s a good idea to check with your dohctor before upping your intake of omega-3.\n7. Caffeine\nCaffeine is a bronchodilator, which means it can help open up the pathways into the lungs. Also, it can help reduce respiratory muscle fatigue.\nA 2022 study found that drinking between 0.5 and 3 cups of coffee or tea daily can help reduce the likelihood of getting adult-onset asthma. Also, keeping caffeine consumption between 160 and 305 milligrams (mg) daily also reduces the chance of developing adult asthma.\nAnother 2020 study\nTrusted Source\nin a Korean population also showed that drinking 1 to 2 cups of coffee daily may help reduce the chance of getting asthma, particularly for women. But no similar link was found between asthma and caffeinated drinks like green tea or soda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreathing exercises\nSeveral different breathing exercises may help relieve symptoms of asthma. These include:\n8. Buteyko Breathing Technique\nThe Buteyko Breathing Technique (BBT) is a system of breathing exercises. BBT focuses on breathing out of your nose instead of your mouth. Breathing out of your mouth can dry your airways and make them more sensitive.\nWhile there\u2019s no research-based evidence\nTrusted Source\nthat using BBT helps reduce the use of asthma medication, it may help reduce your asthma symptoms through slow, gentle breathing.\nSome people may experience less respiratory infections from using this technique. Others who practice BBT believe that it helps to raise your carbon dioxide levels. Still, there isn\u2019t conclusive evidence to support this theory.\n9. Papworth method\nThe Papworth method is a breathing and relaxation technique used since the 1960s to help people with asthma. It involves using your nose and diaphragm to develop breathing patterns. You can then apply these breathing patterns to various activities that may cause your asthma to flare-up.\nAccording to research\nTrusted Source\n, this breathing exercise does seem to help improve lung function and breathing in asthmatic people. That said, more research on the effect the Papworth method and other breathing modalities is needed to determine the full benefits.\nA training course is usually recommended before adopting the exercises as part of your daily routine.\n10. Yoga\nYoga incorporates stretching and breathing exercises to help boost flexibility and increase overall fitness. For many people, practicing yoga can decrease stress, which may trigger your asthma.\nStudies have found that people trained in Yoga may experience fewer asthma attacks and have better results in breathing tests.\nshows that asthma can have not only physical and environmental triggers but also psychological ones, such as stress, anxiety, or depression. Trying different ways of mental grounding or psychological treatment may help reduce asthma flare-ups in some cases.\n11. Hypnotherapy\nIn hypnotherapy, hypnosis makes a person more relaxed and open to new ways to think, feel, and behave. Hypnotherapy may also help facilitate muscle relaxation, which may help people with asthma cope with symptoms like chest tightness.\nThis may explain why a 2021 study on hypnotherapy found that people with known psychological asthma triggers can find some symptom relief with this treatment.\n12. Mindfulness and meditation\nMindfulness is a type of meditation that focuses on how the mind and the body are feeling in the present moment. It can be practiced almost anywhere.\nAll that you need is a quiet place to sit down, close your eyes, and focus your attention on the thoughts, feelings, and sensations in your body.\nBecause of its stress-relieving benefits, mindfulness may help to complement your prescription medication and relieve stress-related asthma symptoms.\n\n\n\nOther alternative therapies\nThere\u2019s some evidence that acupuncture and speleotherapy may help reduce asthma symptom severity.\n13. Acupuncture\nAcupuncture is a form of Traditional Chinese medicine that involves placing small needles into specific points on the body. Some people with asthma may find that acupuncture helps to improve airflow and manage symptoms like chest pain.\nOne 2017 study\nTrusted Source\nfound that adding acupuncture to your daily routine may help improve your quality of life if you\u2019re living with allergic asthma.\nAnother 2015 study\nTrusted Source\nthat compared acupuncture and traditional asthma treatments found that those who did acupuncture during the study showed more improvement in immune system and lung function tests than those who tool traditional asthma medications.\nHowever, the long-term benefits of acupuncture have not yet been proven effective against asthma.\n14. Speleotherapy\nSpeleotherapy is a type of dry salt therapy. It involves spending time in a salt room, introducing tiny particles into the respiratory system.\nOne 2018 study on asthma in children found that after 4 weeks of speleotherapy, symptoms seemed to improve, as well as levels of nitric oxide, which is a marker for asthma inflammation.\nAnother 2020 study\nTrusted Source\nfound that combining speleotherapy with winter exercise or sports may help reduce asthma symptoms.",

For example, omega-3 fatty acids found naturally in high-fat fish like salmon, mackerel, and cod may help your body fight inflammation. Whether this may help people who have asthma is still unproven.\n\n10 Natural Remedies for Asthma\nMany things get credit for being natural asthma remedies. But because studies on complementary and alternative treatments for asthma have been limited, it\u2019s not clear how safe and effective all of them are.\nThese natural remedies have been studied:\n\n\n\nAcupuncture. This traditional Chinese treatment involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. While some people with asthma say acupuncture eases their symptoms, there\u2019s little proof that it works as an asthma treatment.\nBiofeedback. Learning to control your heart rate may help you manage your asthma, but more studies are needed to confirm a benefit.\nHerbs and natural dietary supplements. Many people use herbs, plants, and supplements, especially Chinese herbs, to treat asthma. It\u2019s not clear how well many of them work. More research is needed on supplements like magnesium and fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids). But vitamins C, D, and E may help lower your risk of symptoms.\n\n\n\nAsthma diet. If you have a food allergy, avoiding trigger foods may also help with some asthma symptoms.\nPlant-based diet. Several studies have found benefits for people with asthma who follow the Mediterranean diet.It involves lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats like olive oil. You eat more fatty fish and poultry than red meat. Experts think this diet helps with asthma symptoms because it helps fight inflammation in your body. A similar eating plan called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) may also improve asthma control.\n\u2028\n\nWeight loss. Most people who have extra pounds carry them in the middle of their body. This can make it harder for your lungs to work. Losing weight can improve lung volume and lower your chances of conditions that make asthma worse, like diabetes or high blood pressure. It may also make exercise easier, which could improve your asthma symptoms.\nCaffeine. Caffeine is a mild bronchodilator, which means it helps open your airways. Studies have found that it may improve airway function in people who have asthma.\nYoga. Stress may trigger asthma symptoms. Breathing exercises used in yoga have been found to help some people with asthma control breathing and relieve stress, a common asthma trigger.\nButeyko breathing. This technique focuses on slow breathing and short periods when you hold your breath. It doesn\u2019t treat asthma, but it may help improve the pattern of your breathing.\nPapworth method. This relaxation and breathing system teaches you to breathe from your diaphragm so your lungs fill with as much air as possible.",

This research delineates the effectiveness of supplementing vitamin D in asthmatic patients based on age, as younger patients did not experience improvements.\nAdditional support for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in adult patients can be found in the second phase of the cohort study by Solidoro et al., which involves vitamin D supplementation (100, 000 IU IM x1 followed by 5,000 oral doses weekly, and 400 IU oral doses daily) over one year [12]. They found that for patients\u00a0with initial vitamin D levels of less than 20ng/mL, there was a reduction in asthma exacerbation rate (from 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 to 1.6 \u00b1 1.1, p < 0.001), circulating eosinophils (from 395 \u00b1 330 to 272 \u00b1 212 106/L, p < 0.001), and need of oral corticosteroids courses (from 35 to 20, p = 0.007) and improvement of airway obstruction [12] unlike in asthmatic patients with higher initial levels of vitamin D. This research implies that supplementing vitamin D in asthmatic patients having low levels of vitamin D is beneficial for reducing flare-ups.",

Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13) induce asthma-like changes in the airways and lung parenchyma, as airway eosinophilia, pulmonary lymphocytosis, mastocytosis, alternative macrophage activation, and epithelial cell proliferation with goblet cell hyperplasia. Previous studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases, members of a family of enzymes that cleave extracellular matrix proteins, are implicated in many inflammatory conditions (29). Specifically, in asthma, MMP9 levels are significantly increased (30). Treatment with LGG has been shown to decrease MMP9 expression in lung tissue and to inhibit inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, in OVA-sensitized mice, LGG reduced OVA-specific IgE levels in serum, suppressed the airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine and decreased the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells and Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum (31). Similar results have been reported with other probiotics (32).\nSpecifically, in pediatric asthma, LGG was reported to reduce the concentration of exhaled nitric oxide among 4- to 7-year-olds (33), but these results could not be replicated (34).\nEarly administration of Lactobacillus reuteri to infants did not result in a reduction of asthma [RR 1.16 (0.33\u20134.10)], nor did Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 [RR 0.95 (0.62\u2013145)] or Lactobacillus paracasei spp. paracasei F19 [RR 1.05 (0.39-2.81)] (35\u201337).\nBetter results have been obtained with probiotic bacteria based on in vitro modulation of cytokine production. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. lactis, and Lc. lactis were shown to have a good IL-10-inducing capacity and to exert a significant inhibition of Th2-related cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 (38\u201340). Administered perinatally in a selected combination, they reduced the development of eczema up to the age of 2\u2009years. Their beneficial effect does not reach the age of 6\u2009years and does not lead to primary prevention of asthma.",

Introduction\nAsthma is an important issue for healthcare because of its high prevalence; consequently, asthma represents a relevant burden for the healthcare system [1]. In particular, asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in children and adolescents, affecting, for instance, ten percent of Italian school-aged subjects [2].\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease sustained by chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, reversible airflow limitation, and bronchial hyperreactivity [3]. In addition, symptoms and bronchial obstruction may vary over time and in intensity.\nClinical, functional, and pathological features define asthma phenotypes and endotypes [3]. In this context, the type-2 phenotype is the most frequent in childhood; mostly, allergic asthma is predominant in this context [4].",

Additionally, other natural-derived products have been widely cited in asthma treatment, such as natural oils from plants and animals, which can be obtained by different extraction process [52, 53].\nPlant-derived natural oils represent the main natural products used on the complementary asthma therapy due to the presence of compounds such as phenylpropanoids and mono- and sesquiterpenes as the major bioactive compounds, which provide their anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial, and anesthetic properties [54\u201356]. Similarly, oils obtained from animal sources have been used. They are rich in a mixture of different saturated, mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as compounds from animal organs and secretions, which are responsible for the immune-modulatory action and regulation of the tissue oxidative capacity [57, 58]. The activity credited to the oils derived from plants and animals is related to the presence of those bioactive compounds, which can inhibit COX-2 and COX-5. Additionally, these compounds are able to modulate the immune cells function by reducing levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 cytokines, decreasing the activity and proliferation of NK cells and leading to an increase in the level of endogenous corticosteroids, contributing to the regulation of NF-\u03baB pathway, and reducing the mucus production and the inflammation in the lung tissues [59\u201361].\n",

In this sense, the direction of the effect indicated benefit or potential harm of CBT compared with the control group. If other adverse events were reported that did not fall under these categories, we described them narratively.\nReporting one or more of the outcomes listed here in the study was not an inclusion criterion for the review.\nIf different scales measuring the same outcome were used across studies, we pooled them in the same analysis using standardised mean differences if we judged this to be appropriate.\n",

In addition, asthma in people who are obese may be more severe and more difficult to treat. Eating a balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight may make it easier to manage your condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nFoods to add to your diet\nAdd these:\nVitamin D-rich foods, such as milk and eggs\nBeta carotene-rich vegetables, such as carrots and leafy greens\nMagnesium-rich foods, such as spinach and pumpkin seeds\n\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no specific diet recommended for asthma, but there are some foods and nutrients that may help support lung function:\nVitamin D\nGetting enough vitamin D may help reduce the number of asthma attacks in children ages 6 to 15, according to the Vitamin D Council. Sources of vitamin D include:\nsalmon\nmilk and fortified milk\nfortified orange juice\neggs\nIf you know you have allergies to milk or eggs, you may want to avoid them as a source of vitamin D. Allergic symptoms from a food source can manifest as asthma.\nVitamin A\nA 2018 study\nTrusted Source\nfound that children with asthma typically had lower levels of vitamin A in their blood than children without asthma. In children with asthma, higher levels of vitamin A also corresponded to better lung function. Good sources of vitamin A are:\ncarrots\ncantaloupe\nsweet potatoes\nleafy greens, such as romaine lettuce, kale, and spinach\nbroccoli\nApples\nAn apple a day may keep asthma away. According to a research review article in Nutrition Journal, apples were associated with a lower risk of asthma and increased lung function.\nBananas\nA survey published in the European Respiratory Journal found that bananas might decrease wheezing in children with asthma. This may be due to the fruit\u2019s antioxidant and potassium content, which may improve lung function.\nMagnesium\nA study in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that children ages 11 to 19 who had low magnesium levels also had low lung flow and volume. Kids can improve their magnesium levels by eating magnesium-rich foods such as:\nspinach\npumpkin seeds\nSwiss chard\ndark chocolate\nsalmon\nInhaling magnesium\nTrusted Source\n(through a nebulizer) is another good way to treat asthma attacks.\n\n",

Additionally, increased fruit and vegetable intake, reduced animal product consumption, and weight management might mediate cytokine release, free radical damage, and immune responses involved in the development and course of asthma. The specific aim of this review paper is to examine the current literature on the associations between dietary factors and asthma risk and control in children and adults. Clinical trials examining the mechanism(s) by which dietary factors influence asthma outcomes are necessary to identify the potential use of nutritional therapy in the prevention and management of asthma.",

                "context": "Respiratory therapists need to periodically monitor asthma patients to prevent asthma exacerbations.\nDevelop an asthma action plan for each patient with asthma. Every plan should contain emergency contact numbers, peak flow readings, rescue medications, warning signs of an episode, action steps to take during an episode, and environmental triggers. IDEM has created an Asthma Action Plan that includes all of these elements. Be sure patients and their caregivers know how to read the plan. The patient\u2019s physician should sign and date the plan and update annually. Although studies have shown that these plans do not prevent exacerbations, it is essential in the event of a serious \u201cattack\u201d the patient (and others around them, such as the school nurse or teachers) knows how to handle it and when to call for help. \u2028\nIdentify the patient\u2019s asthma triggers. Studies have shown that for a long-term asthma management plan to be successful, it is vital to control all factors that have been shown to increase asthma symptoms and/or cause exacerbations. What type of asthma does the patient have: allergic, non-allergic, exercised-induced, or occupational? Do symptoms only occur at night? Talk with the patient about when and where they experience asthma symptoms. What was the patient doing when symptoms began? It is important to determine a patient\u2019s sensitivity to indoor allergens. Question the patient on the four most common indoor allergen exposures; dust mites, cockroaches, pets, and molds. IDEM has developed a list of Questions to Identify Patient Environmental Asthma Triggers that can be used. Be sure each patient with asthma has received an allergy skin test to identify sensitivities to allergens. After exposure to an asthma trigger, the patient may not experience any symptoms for hours, even days. Recommend the patient keep a daily journal. \u2028\nRecommend that patients with asthma receive an influenza vaccine. Respiratory illnesses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and rhinovirus) put added burden on the lungs of asthma patients. \u2028\nDemonstrate new medical devices and new medications. Explain the difference in long-term controller medications and quick-relief medications. Be sure the patient understands the importance of continuing to take the long-term controller medication, even when they have gone long periods without asthma symptoms. Show the patient how to measure their lung function with a peak-flow meter. Be sure the patient is familiar with using a spacer for inhaled medications if necessary. \u2028\n",

                "context": "Here are a few things that have worked for me:\n1. Explain How Your Asthma Feel\nIn an ideal world, every time we talk about asthma, we\u2019d be understood. But the reality of it is, asthma is an invisible disease.\nThis is because it\u2019s not always obvious. It doesn\u2019t show up like a cut or a limp, for example. And it\u2019s not always present.\nBecause of this, I\u2019ve found it helpful to explain how it feels to experience an asthma attack, from the trigger to the fear, the full-out attack, and even the treatment and recovery (because let\u2019s face it, treatment is usually a drawn-out, frustrating process).\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to scare anyone when I talk about asthma. But I do take a fairly serious tone when sharing my experiences.\n2. Share Asthma Triggers With Friends and Family\nI\u2019ve found that sharing what triggers my asthma, with family and friends, has encouraged them to keep a watchful eye out for potential problems.\nAnd I\u2019ll take all the help I can get.\nFor example, I have extended family that smokes regularly. But after explaining my asthma to them (and that one of my biggest triggers is cigarette smoke), they\u2019ve altered their own behavior when I\u2019m around to avoid triggering my asthma. In other words, they don\u2019t smoke around me.\n3. Share Asthma Information\nFor friends and family who aren\u2019t as compassionate (for a lack of a better word), we might resort to sharing scholarly articles with them to help educate.\nUnfortunately, asthma is something that is often brushed off (because remember, it\u2019s kind of invisible). But not just because it\u2019s difficult to see; it\u2019s also brushed off because others cry wolf or downplay it.\nFor example, sometimes, people who haven't been diagnosed with asthma refer to themselves as asthmatics (perhaps they\u2019ve self-diagnosed), and because of this, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re crying wolf for the rest of us.\nPointing to credible information on asthma can help us educate our loved ones on what we\u2019re feeling and the severity (and realness) of the condition.\n4. Create a Pamphlet\nWhen I was younger, my mother had a hard time explaining asthma to educators. Now, this was a long time ago \u2026 but to get the point across, she put together information from doctors and articles to help spread the word about what to watch for when it comes to asthma triggers and children.\n5. Just Be Honest\nIf you have friends and family that want to help you manage your asthma, be open with them about your triggers.\nIf you\u2019re comfortable, invite them in on your journey with asthma. Because there\u2019s nothing better than feeling like you have a friend nearby when asthma acts up.\nLastly, if friends and family just don\u2019t seem to understand, there are support groups available online. Connecting with other people with asthma can help you feel connected and supported.\n",

To date, the evidence points towards a combination of both heightened and suppressed inflammatory responses in smokers compared with nonsmokers with asthma.\nThe mechanisms of corticosteroid resistance in asthmatic smokers are unexplained, but could be as a result of alterations in airway inflammatory cell phenotypes (e.g. increased neutrophils or reduced eosinophils), changes in the glucocorticoid receptor-\u03b1 to -\u03b2 ratio (e.g. overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor \u03b2), and increased activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (e.g. nuclear factor-\u03baB) or reduced histone deacetylase activity.\nIn conclusion, every effort should be made to encourage asthmatics who smoke to stop, although the effects of smoking cessation upon reversing the adverse effects of tobacco smoke on asthma control, therapeutic response to corticosteroids and airway pathology have yet to be fully elucidated. Alternative or additional therapies to inhaled corticosteroids are needed for asthmatic patients who are unable to quit smoking.\n",

Non-allergic asthma (minus hayfever) was 58 per cent more common in children with a father who smoked before conception and fathers who smoked before the age of 15 were three times as likely to have asthmatic children; this only dropped to 2.7 times for those who started early, but who stopped smoking five years before conceiving a child. Women who stopped smoking before conceiving were no more likely to have a child with asthma.29\n",

In spite of chronic respiratory symptoms, it is remarkable that asthma sufferers commence and continue smoking with prevalence rates relatively close to those found in the general population [2\u20135]. This paradox may be partially explained by the highly addictive nature of tobacco smoking and the remitting characteristic of asthma, particularly in its mild-to-moderate forms.",

You\u2019re around three times more likely to quit if you use treatments alongside stop smoking support. For example, using a local stop smoking service and using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or e-cigarettes.\nYou\u2019re also more likely to be successful with the support of friends, family, and your doctor or stop smoking adviser.\u00a0\nStop smoking service\nLocal stop smoking services give you free expert advice and support to stop smoking.\nYour GP will be able to refer you. You can also contact your local stop smoking service yourself, for support.\nIf you have a long-term lung condition, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis, your doctor should offer you support in stopping smoking every time you meet them.\nThe NHS has information about what to expect from a stop smoking service. Depending on where you live in the UK, sessions may be by phone or video call, or in person at GP surgeries or pharmacies.\nYou may be offered support through an app, text messages or another digital platform in addition to help you stop smoking. There are plenty of apps available to help you stop smoking \u2013 search online for one that suits you. You may want to try the Smokefree app. It\u2019s a four-week programme of practical support, encouragement, and tailored advice.\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT)\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) comes in different forms and helps you to control the urge to smoke. It\u2019s available on prescription from your GP or local stop smoking service, or to buy from a pharmacy.\nAll the therapies give you a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals that are in tobacco smoke. Over time you can slowly reduce the amount of nicotine you get, and eventually stop using NTR completely.\nTherapies include:\n\tpatches\u00a0\n\tgum\n\tsprays\n\tlozenges\n\tinhalators.\nMost people will combine two types of NRT. This is usually a nicotine patch to provide a background level of NRT and a faster-acting product, such as gum, inhalator, or nasal spray, to use when you get cravings.\nPeople usually take NRT for 8-12 weeks before slowly reducing the dose and stopping. Ask your GP, pharmacist or stop smoking service for help in choosing the right NRTs for you.\n\nStop smoking medicines\nYour GP can prescribe you medicine to help you stop smoking. There is currently one medicine available on the NHS, called Bupropion (Zyban).\nIf you\u2019re prescribed Zyban, you\u2019ll need to take the tablets for around 7 to 9 weeks.\n\nHypnotherapy and other ways to quit\nSome people find complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy, or meditation help them quit smoking.\nHowever, there's no clear evidence to prove they can help people quit, and they\u2019re not available on the NHS as part of a stop smoking plan.\nAlongside licensed stop smoking treatments and expert support, there\u2019s nothing to stop you trying complementary therapies too. They could support your overall stop smoking plan. Lots of complementary therapies also help with stress.",

Increased difficulty breathing.\n\u201cYou may notice more shortness of breath during normal activities,\u201d Dr. Krishnaswamy says. For example, if you used to be able to carry a grocery bag from your car to your kitchen with ease and now you are huffing and puffing, that could be a sign of worsening asthma.\n2. A drop in peak flow meter readings.\n\u201cFor people with asthma, a peak flow meter is like a blood pressure cuff for people with high blood pressure \u2014 it gives you an objective measurement of your condition,\u201d Krishnaswamy says. Chronically lower peak flow meter readings can indicate that your asthma is getting worse.\n3. Exercise limitations.\nIf you\u2019re lacking the motivation you used to have for working out, or you\u2019re experiencing decreased stamina or trouble breathing during exercise, your asthma may be getting worse.\n4. Using a quick-relief inhaler more often.\n\u201cI saw this happen with my own mother,\u201d Krishnaswamy says. \u201cShe was breathless and needing to use her rescue inhaler more and more frequently.\u201d If you need to use quick-relief medicine more than twice a week, your asthma isn\u2019t under control, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n5. Waking up at night with coughing or wheezing.\n\u201cAttacks at nighttime that wake you up at 2 in the morning with coughing and wheezing and reaching for your rescue inhaler are a sign your asthma is poorly controlled or getting worse,\u201d Krishnaswamy says.\n6. Having to disrupt your normal routine because of asthma.\nDuring times of high stress, you might experience a flare that causes you to miss school or work. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re having a stressful morning \u2014 your child is sick \u2014 and your asthma worsens, then it quickly reverses once the stress has passed,\u201d Krishnaswamy says. But if your asthma symptoms are keeping you home from work or school on a regular basis, the condition is likely getting worse.\n",

Outside of these few episodes, a child with intermittent asthma is free of asthma symptoms.\nAny child with asthma symptoms more often than 2 days a week or 2 nights per month, on average, is felt to no longer have intermittent asthma but persistent asthma. Persistent asthma has 3 levels of severity.\nMild Persistent Asthma\nIn mild persistent asthma, symptoms occur more than twice a week but less than once a day, and flare-ups may affect activity. Nighttime flare-ups occur more often than twice a month but less than once a week. Lung function is 80% of normal or greater.\nModerate Persistent Asthma\nAsthma is classified as moderate persistent if symptoms occur daily. Flare-ups occur and usually last several days. Coughing and wheezing may disrupt the child\u2019s normal activities and make it difficult to sleep. Nighttime flare-ups may occur more than once a week. In moderate persistent asthma, lung function is roughly between 60% and 80% of normal, without treatment.\nSevere Persistent Asthma\nWith severe persistent asthma, symptoms occur daily and often. They also frequently curtail the child\u2019s activities or disrupt his sleep. Lung function is less than 60% of the normal level without treatment. Severe is the least-common asthma level.\n\n",

These medicines often are inhaled directly into the lungs. Within minutes, they open up the airways and relieve symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.\nNot taking quick-relief medicines (also called rescue or fast-acting medicines) during an asthma flare-up can be very harmful. A child might not be able to take a deep breath, and the airways can continue to tighten until the child must go to the ER.\nMake sure your child always has quick-relief medicine handy in case of an emergency.",

                "context": "Can I travel if I have a lung condition?\nBefore planning a trip, speak to your doctor for advice. If you haven\u2019t seen your doctor recently, it\u2019s worth arranging a review and making sure your self-management plan or asthma action plan is up to date.\nTravelling abroad can take more planning than travelling in the UK, especially if you\u2019re flying. You should give yourself enough time to speak to your doctor before travelling. They will be able to advise you about taking medicine or equipment abroad. If you\u2019re planning to fly, they can also tell you if you\u2019ll need to do a fitness-to-fly (hypoxic challenge) test.\nYour doctor will be able to give you advice about any vaccines you might need before you travel. If you take oral steroids or immunosuppressive medicine, see your doctor at least eight weeks before you plan to leave. You may not be able to have some vaccines, or you may need a vaccine further in advance before going away.\nYou can find more information and advice on the NHS Fitfortravel website.\nWhat to consider when planning a trip\nWhen you\u2019re planning a trip, it\u2019s good to think about things like:\nWeather\nVery warm or cold weather can affect you and lead to flare-ups or an asthma attack. Hot weather also increases the amount of ozone in the air, which can make symptoms worse.\u00a0\nWeather changes like heat, cold, humidity or thunderstorms can make symptoms of lung conditions worse. For some people with asthma, they can trigger attacks.\u00a0\nWe have more advice about keeping your lungs healthy in hot weather and cold weather, and about weather as an asthma trigger.\nPollution\nAir pollution is harmful to everyone, but people with lung conditions are more at risk.\nPollutants can irritate your lungs and trigger symptoms, so you may want to consider the air quality at your destination.\nYou can find information about air quality in the UK on the Defra website. You can check the air quality of locations around the world on the World Air Quality Index website.\nHigh altitude\nYour lungs get less oxygen at high altitude, for example in mountainous areas. This can make it more difficult for people with lung conditions, so it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor before travelling.\nFor some conditions, your doctor may suggest you have a test to see if you should use oxygen while at high altitude. If you already use oxygen, they may suggest you increase your flow rate.\nPollen\nPollen can trigger symptoms for some people with lung conditions. Some people find they actually get fewer symptoms from pollen when abroad, because they\u2019re not allergic to some native trees and grasses in the way they are in the UK.\u00a0\nYou still might want to avoid going to countries that have high pollen levels, especially during their pollen season. There are plenty of destinations that have lower pollen levels. Areas by the coast also tend to have lower pollen counts.\nAccommodation\nIf your condition is triggered by things like cigarette smoke, pets or dust mites, you should check whether these could be a problem at your accommodation. If you cannot avoid a trigger, make sure you follow your treatment plan and take your medicines as prescribed to lower your risk of symptoms.\nIf you have access needs, we have more information about finding accommodation.\u2028\u00a0\nFlying with a lung condition\nMost people with a lung condition can travel safely on planes, but you should talk to your doctor before you make any plans.\u00a0\nYou may need a fitness-to-fly (hypoxic challenge) test to confirm whether you need in-flight oxygen. We have specific information about flying with oxygen.\n\nIf you have asthma or COPD\u2026\n\nIf you have an interstitial lung disease (ILD)\u2026\n\nIf you have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and you use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\u2026\n\nContact the airline before you book to discuss your needs. If you\u2019ll need assistance, tell your airline at least 48 hours before flying.\u00a0\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority provides detailed guidance about special assistance for air passengers. Find out more about the help you\u2019re entitled to in the UK and the EU on the GOV.UK website.\nTravelling with medicine\nGive yourself plenty of time to organise medicines for the whole of your trip. Discuss your plans with your doctor at least two months before you plan to travel. \u00a0\nFor some conditions like severe asthma, COPD, or interstitial lung disease, your doctor may prescribe an emergency supply of antibiotics or steroids.\nWill my medicine be allowed?\nDifferent countries have different rules about the types of medicine they allow to be taken into the country, and how much you can take in. Make sure you check the rules for all the countries you\u2019re going to, even if you\u2019re just passing through them.\nSome prescribed medicines contain controlled drugs and may require a personal licence to take abroad.\u00a0\nInternational rules vary \u2013 contact the embassy for the country you're visiting. GOV.UK has a full list of foreign embassies in the UK.\nTaking your prescription and a letter from your GP\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a good idea to travel with a copy of your prescription and a letter from your GP with:\n\tdetails of your medicine\u00a0\n\tthe name of the health condition you need it for.\nThese will help if security staff ask about your medicine at customs. They will also be useful if you need medical help while you\u2019re away.\nYour GP may charge for writing this letter, as it\u2019s not a required NHS service.\nFlying with medicine\nIf you\u2019re flying, you should carry your medicines and any medical equipment in your hand luggage. Keep your medicines and medical equipment in their original, correctly labelled packages. If you can, split your medicines between several bags, so you have some available if one bag goes missing.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a good idea to take paper copies of all your prescriptions with you. You can also keep photos of them on your phone or view them in the NHS app.\nIf you need to take medical equipment or more than 100ml of liquid or gel medicine in your hand luggage, you\u2019ll need a letter from your doctor or a copy of your prescription.\u00a0\nTravelling with medicine checklist\nCheck the expiry dates for your medicines to be sure that they are valid for the whole of your holiday.\u00a0\n\tMake sure you\u2019ll have enough medicine and equipment to cover your whole trip.\n\tMake sure you have a copy of your prescription and a letter from your GP with you.\u00a0\n\tSome medicines need to be stored at room temperature or in the fridge. If you need advice on how to keep your medicines cool, talk to your GP or pharmacist. They might advise you to store your medicines in a thermos flask or cooler bag.\u00a0\n\tIf you\u2019re given medicine abroad, check whether it can be brought back into the UK. If you\u2019re in any doubt, declare the medicine at customs along with your doctor\u2019s letter.\u00a0\n\tTake a photo of your passport, prescriptions, and insurance policy details to keep on your phone, so you always have a copy with you.\n\tIf you use a reliever inhaler, make sure you can find it quickly in an emergency.\u00a0\n\tIf you use a spacer, don\u2019t travel with it in a plastic bag, as this will cause it to build up static. Try a medicine bag instead, and make sure it\u2019s easy to find if you need it.\u00a0\n\tIf you have a rescue pack for flare-ups, make sure it is stocked and make sure you know when to use it. Talk to your GP if you\u2019re not sure.\n\tIf you normally use a peak flow meter, take it on holiday so you can monitor your symptoms while you\u2019re away.\n\tIf you use equipment like a nebuliser or CPAP machine, remember that other countries may have different electric sockets and voltages, so you may need an adaptor or battery-powered equipment. If you\u2019re not sure, check with the manufacturer or your healthcare professional.\u00a0\n\tMost airlines allow battery-operated medical equipment to be used on board, but do not allow ones that need a mains supply. Check with your airline about carrying and using your equipment on the plane.\u00a0\u2028\u00a0\nBe prepared for emergencies\nWhen travelling with a lung condition, you should be prepared for emergencies, like a flare-up or asthma attack. Make sure you:\n\talways carry your reliever inhaler with you if you use one\n\ttake a list of emergency numbers you might need\n\thave details of your emergency contact with you and keep them somewhere accessible\n\ttake extra medicine with you in separate bags in case any luggage gets lost\n\thave your self-management plan or asthma action plan and make sure it lists details of the treatments you need in an emergency. It\u2019s helpful to give this to the people you\u2019re travelling with and healthcare professionals if necessary.",

                "context": "Any parent of a child with asthma knows all too well that for kids, living with asthma can mean dealing with symptoms like shortness of breath and coughing that can interfere with playing or sleeping. Asthma is also a leading cause of missed school days, emergency room visits, and even hospitalizations.\u00a0According\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than four million children \u2014 about 1 in 12 kids \u2014 ages 17 and younger had asthma in 2020, and more than 41 percent of kids with asthma reported having one or more asthma attacks.\nBut while asthma may be a chronic condition that causes mild to severe breathing problems, the good news is that symptoms can be controlled by avoiding or reducing exposure to allergens and irritants, making sure you and your children learn about asthma control strategies, and working with your child\u2019s doctor to manage and prevent symptoms. \u201cAsthma is a very manageable disease,\u201d says Scott Schroeder, MD, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. \u201cKids should be able to sleep well at night and play whatever sports they want, but it takes work.\u201d\nHere are some strategies you can follow to help your child breathe easier.\n1. Schedule Regular Doctor\u2019s Appointments\nKids often need to take prescription medication, like steroids and bronchodilators,\u00a0to keep their asthma under control. Your child\u2019s healthcare provider will design a treatment plan and reevaluate it at each visit, says Dr. Schroeder. To make sure that your child is using an inhaler correctly, your doctor may also ask for a demonstration, notes the Mayo Clinic.\n\nSchroeder usually asks his new patients to return for a follow-up visit a month or two after their first appointment; this way, he can see how their treatment plan is working. He also rechecks people every three months, six months, and up to a year, depending on how well they\u2019re doing. Schroeder recommends scheduling a new appointment if your child\u2019s symptoms don\u2019t improve with new treatment.\nRELATED: 7 Ways Your Doctor Can Help if Your Current Asthma Treatment Isn\u2019t Working\n2. Make Sure You Have a Written Asthma Action Plan\nWork with your child\u2019s healthcare provider to develop a written plan for managing symptoms and handling emergencies. \u201cIt\u2019s all about empowering the family to do the right things,\u201d says Schroeder. Keep a copy on hand (the refrigerator is a good spot) and make sure your child\u2019s school nurse has one too.\nA well written plan should be simple and understandable, but should also contain details on how to monitor your child\u2019s asthma, what to do when your child doesn\u2019t feel well or experiences a flare-up, how to adjust their medication, and when to see the doctor, says Harold J. Farber, MD, professor of pediatrics in\u00a0the pulmonary section at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00:01 / 00:10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n10 Tips to Help Your Child Manage Asthma\n\n\n\n3. Try to Shift From Crisis to Control\nVisualize your ultimate goal as preventive maintenance rather than a response to problems. \u201cIf your child is having a lot of crises, you may need a new asthma action plan,\u201d says Dr. Farber. For instance, frequent or persistent symptom flares may also be a sign that she needs a change in treatment, such as the addition of a long-term control medication.\nFarber uses the analogy of avoiding falling off a cliff to describe the ideal asthma management: You can either prevent a fall by hanging off of the edge or by moving away from the edge, says Farber. If you notice that your child is experiencing asthma attacks or symptom flares, you may need to discuss formulating a new plan with your child\u2019s doctor.\nRELATED: Asthma Treatment and Using an Inhaler\n\n4. Help Your Child Use Their Medication and Peak Flow Meter\nSometimes, asthma treatment comes in pill form; other times, it includes devices such as inhalers, nebulizers, or peak flow meters, and your child will need to learn how to use them correctly to maximize their effectiveness. Talk with your doctor about which options are best for your child.\nSome children do better with nebulizers, but by age 2\u00bd, many kids can use an inhaler, says Schroeder. He recommends using an inhaler spacer, a small device that connects to the inhaler\u2019s mouthpiece. \u201cIt takes out the need for hand-eye coordination,\u201d he says. Your doctor will demonstrate how to use these devices, and you should also help your child use them, especially in the beginning.\nWhether your child is prescribed inhaled or oral asthma medication, you can make it easier for them to remember to take their dosage by making it part of the daily routine, says Farber. \u201cIf your child needs medication daily, link it to brushing teeth or have him take it before meals,\u201d suggests Farber.\n5. Schedule a Flu Shot for Your Child\nEven in kids who have mild asthma or well-controlled symptoms, the flu can be a serious infection. That\u2019s because in people with asthma, the airways are more swollen and sensitive, and the influenza virus can cause more inflammation of the airways and the lungs. According\u00a0to the CDC, the flu can trigger asthma attacks and flare-up of symptoms, and increase the risk of developing other respiratory illnesses like pneumonia.\nAn influenza vaccine is a must because it can reduce your child\u2019s risk of getting sick in the first place. You can get one from your child\u2019s doctor or a local pharmacy any time, ideally every autumn.\n6. Limit Your Kid\u2019s Exposure to Triggers and Allergens\nMinimize your child\u2019s exposure to allergens like pollen, dust, mold, or pet dander, all of which may give him or her breathing trouble. If seasonal allergies are a problem, your doctor might recommend increasing medication during the tough times.\n\u201cHow you breathe starts with what you breathe,\u201d says Farber. He recommends also paying attention to other possible triggers, like strong household chemicals such as cleaning products or scent diffusers.\n7. Shield Your Child From Smoke\nIf you smoke, you could damage your child\u2019s lungs. In a study published in 2015, children in Japan with a father and mother who smoked indoors had a 43 to 72 percent increased odds of hospitalization for asthma \u2014 and the risk was similar if the parents smoked outdoors, too. Even thirdhand smoke \u2014 the particles that linger in carpets, couches, and other materials \u2014 may be harmful, says\u00a0the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. \u201cThe only way to eliminate exposure is to stop smoking,\u201d says Farber. If you smoke, talk with your doctor about strategies to help you quit.\n8. Keep Emergency Medication Handy\nEquip your household with the medicines your child\u2019s doctor has prescribed for emergencies, and ensure that your child\u2019s school nurse has them too. Check your school\u2019s policy to see whether children can keep medication in their backpacks. \u201cI like to empower kids to use the inhaler at school if the school will allow it,\u201d says Schroeder.\n9. Give Your Child Positive Role Models\nTell your kid about successful people who didn\u2019t let asthma bring them down. President Theodore Roosevelt had asthma, according to research from 2015. Soccer icon David Beckham, singer Pink, and actress Jessica Alba all have it too, per CBS News. \u201cWe want to keep kids with asthma as healthy as possible so that they can achieve their full potential,\u201d says Schroeder. And set a good example at home by not vaping or smoking, adds Farber.\n10. Encourage Good Expectations\nTeach your child to have a positive outlook about her asthma. \u201cExpect good management and not just crisis control, and teach her to follow her asthma plan,\u201d says Farber. Empowering your child to take control of her asthma can be a key part of how well she manages her condition.",

Younger, prepubertal children, appear more sensitive to the growth suppressive effects of ICS. Asthmatic children receiving conventional doses of ICS (400 \u03bcg/day of BDP equivalent) will attain an adult height indistinguishable from their predicted adult height (based on their mid parental height), and no different from non-asthmatics. Adult height could possibly be decreased in severe asthmatics, but this is unlikely to be greater than a 1.2 cm decrement. Recent longitudinal studies offer reassurance that at conventional doses ICS do not have significant long term effects on growth, and that their benefits consistently outweigh their side effects.\n\n",

                "context": "As with all drugs, asthma medications are known to have side effects. The range of possibilities is wide, from oral thrush to nervousness to glaucoma. Side effects can vary depending on the drug class, the dose, and how it's delivered (by inhalation or by mouth).\n\n <img src=\"https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/jblj9qmTlq3U33-7mD2ZLFkfyVg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/asthma-medication-side-effects-200593.FINAL-ecb38c7028d349228c888e1f67b82509.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" class=\"img--noscript universal-image__image\" srcset=\"https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/l1Si1w0xtqGzImOAgIE_noseszg=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/asthma-medication-side-effects-200593.FINAL-ecb38c7028d349228c888e1f67b82509.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1248px) 1500px, 1500px\" alt=\"Side Effects of Asthma Medications\" />\nVerywell / Laura Porter\nMost asthma medications are well tolerated, though, and the benefits of treatment outweigh the consequences. There may be times, however, when a side effect is severe enough that a dose adjustment or different drug entirely is called for.\n\nHow Asthma Is Treated\n\nInhaled Corticosteroids\nInhaled corticosteroids (commonly known as inhaled steroids) are prescribed to help prevent the symptoms of asthma. When used regularly, they help decrease the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. However, they will not relieve an attack once it has started.\n\nInhaled corticosteroids can cause both local side effects (limited to a part of the body) and systemic side effects (affecting the entire body). Systemic effects tend to be more severe and are typically associated with long-term use.\n\nAmong the possibilities:1\ufeff\n\n\tOral candidiasis (thrush), a common fungal infection of the mouth\n\tDysphonia (hoarseness), usually short-term\n\tSore mouth or throat\n\tReflex cough or tracheal (windpipe) spasms\n\tDecreased bone density in adults\n\tImpaired growth in children, generally slight\n\tEasy bruising\n\tCataracts (clouding of the eye)\n\tGlaucoma (increased pressure in the eye)\n\nThe use of a spacer on the mouthpiece of an inhaler may reduce the risk of side effects from inhaled corticosteroids. Rinsing and gargling after use may also prevent hoarseness and oral thrush.2\ufeff\ufeff\nShort- and Long-Acting Beta Agonists\nShort-acting beta agonists (SABAs) like albuterol are typically used as rescue medications to provide quick relief of asthma symptoms. By contrast, long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) like Severant (salmeterol) continue to work for 12 hours or more.\n\nThe side effects are much the same for SABAs and LABAs, since the two drug classes share similar mechanisms of action, including:3\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\n\tIncreased heart rate\n\tHeadache\n\tDizziness\n\tAnxiety\n\tNervousness or tremors\n\tRash\n\nThough the side effects tend to resolve quickly with SABAs, they can often persist with LABAs. The same can occur when either type of beta agonist is used excessively.\n\nWhile overusing a rescue inhaler can increase your risk of a severe asthma attack, that risk is multiplied if you overuse a LABA. So serious is the concern that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was prompted to issue a black box warning in 2003 advising consumers about the risk of fatal asthma attacks when using the combination inhaler Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol).4\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nTypes of Oral and Inhaled Asthma Drugs\n\nOral Corticosteroids\nOral corticosteroids typically are prescribed for people who've experienced or are at risk of a serious asthma attack. While steroids are delivered intravenously in a hospital setting, they are given in oral form if your symptoms are severe but do not require hospitalization.\n\nSide effects are similar to those of inhaled steroids, albeit more common and severe.\n\nPossible side effects, particularly with long-term use of oral corticosteroids, may include:5\n\n\tWeight gain\n\tFluid retention\n\tHigh blood pressure\n\tElevated blood sugar\n\tGrowth suppression in children\n\tOsteoporosis (bone density loss) in adults\n\tMuscle weakness\n\tCataracts\n\tGlaucoma\n\tType 2 diabetes\n\nFluid retention and elevated blood sugar are also common side effects in those taking oral corticosteroids for a short time.\n\nIf you require an oral steroid like prednisone\u00a0two or more times per year, your asthma is not being well controlled.6 See your healthcare provider and discuss whether an adjustment of treatment is needed.\n5 Things For Better Asthma Control\n\nLeukotriene Modifiers\nSingulair (montelukast) and other leukotriene modifiers work by blocking inflammatory chemicals called leukotrienes, which can trigger bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways) leading to an asthma attack.\n\nCommon side effects of leukotriene modifiers include:7\n\n\tStomach upset\n\tHeadache\n\tFlu-like symptoms\n\tNervousness\n\tNausea or vomiting\n\tNasal congestion\n\tRash\n\nIn most cases, side effects develop within the first month of treatment. Children using leukotriene modifiers may also experience hyperactivity.7\n\nLeukotriene modifiers also carry the risk of serious mental health side effects, and in 2020 the the FDA issued a black box warning about these risks. The FDA recommended that healthcare providers carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits before prescribing it for asthma.\n\nMental health side effects that can occur with leukotriene modifiers include:8\n\n\tAgitation\n\tAggression\n\tDepression\n\tSleep disturbances\n\tSuicidal thoughts\n\tSuicide\n\nContact your healthcare provider immediately if you think you are experiencing a mental health side effect while taking this medication.8\n\nMast Cell Stabilizers\nCromolyn sodium and Alocril (nedocromil) are older therapies used to treat mild persistent asthma. These drugs work by preventing mast cells, a type of white blood cell, from secreting an inflammatory substance called histamine into the bloodstream.\n\nCromolyn sodium and Alocril are well tolerated, with most side effects decreasing with use. These include:9\n\n\tA bad taste in the mouth\n\tCough\n\tItchy or sore throat\n\tHeadache\n\tNasal congestion\n\tAnaphylaxis (rare)\n\nAnaphylaxis is a whole-body, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. If not treated immediately, people with anaphylaxis may experience shock, coma, asphyxiation, heart or respiratory failure, and even death.\n\nWhen to Call 911\nCall for emergency help if you experience some or all of the following after a mast cell stabilizer or immunomodulator, as these are signs of anaphylaxis:\n\tRash or hives\n\tWheezing\n\tShortness of breath\n\tRapid or irregular heartbeats\n\tDizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting\n\tSwelling of the face, tongue, or throat\n\tA feeling of impending doom\nWhat to Know About Allergic Asthma\n\nImmunomodulators\nXolair (omalizumab) is an immunomodulator delivered by injection. The aim of the treatment is to prevent the immune system from over-responding to an asthma trigger.10\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nBecause immunomodulators suppress parts of the immune system, you may be prone to frequent mild-to-moderate infections.\n\nAmong other common side effects of immunomodulators are:11\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\n\tSwelling and pain at the injection site\n\tItchiness\n\tRash\n\tFatigue\n\tCommon cold\n\tEar infections\n\tUpper respiratory tract infections\n\tSinusitis\n\tAcid reflux\n\tHeadache\n\tSore throat\n\tAlopecia (hair loss)\n\tAnaphylaxis (rare)\n\n",

Use an asthma action plan to stay on top of your child\u2019s symptoms\nUsing an action plan means it\u2019s easier to manage your child\u2019s symptoms, and help them stay well with their asthma.\nYour child\u2019s asthma action plan has all the information you need in one place.\nIt tells you:\n\twhat to do every day to help keep your child well\n\twhat to do if your child\u2019s asthma is getting worse\n\twhat to do if your child has an asthma attack\u2028\u00a0\nYou fill in your child\u2019s action plan with your child\u2019s doctor or asthma nurse.\nFind out more about action plans for children here, or download one now.\n2. Help your child take their preventer inhaler every day\nYour child\u2019s preventer medicine keeps down inflammation in their airways. If they take it regularly every day as prescribed, they\u2019re less likely to react to their asthma triggers.\nHelping your child take their inhaler alongside something else they do every morning and evening, like brushing their teeth, can help you get into a good routine.\nFind out more and get more tips on helping your child use their inhaler.\n3. Carry your child\u2019s reliever inhaler with you everywhere\nYour child\u2019s reliever inhaler (usually blue) is essential if they start having asthma symptoms or an asthma attack. Make sure it\u2019s always close by, so you can deal with your child\u2019s symptoms quickly.\nIf your child is at school, ask the school about emergency reliever inhalers.\nFind out more about reliever inhalers.\n4. Check your child\u2019s inhaler technique\nA good inhaler technique can mean fewer symptoms. It also helps prevent side effects like a sore mouth.\nAsk your child\u2019s doctor or nurse to check your child\u2019s technique. You can also ask a pharmacist.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to watch while your child takes their inhaler, to make sure they\u2019re doing it right. They need to rinse out and gargle after taking it too.\nFind out more about using inhalers. You can also watch our videos.\n5. Spotting symptoms\nKnowing how your child\u2019s asthma has been over time can be really helpful when you take them for their asthma review, or other appointments.\nYou can help your child keep an eye on their symptoms with our asthma symptoms calendar and stickers.\nSome children benefit from keeping a peak flow diary for a while too - for example, if they have started a new treatment, or if their GP or asthma nurse wants to find out more about their triggers.\nAlongside symptoms, a drop in their peak flow score is a sign for you to get some more support from their GP or asthma nurse.\n\u00a0\nSee their GP or asthma nurse\nIf your child is having symptoms, or using their reliever three or more times a week, it\u2019s a sign that their asthma is getting worse and they could be at risk of an asthma attack.\nHow your child\u2019s GP or asthma nurse can support you\nYour child\u2019s GP or asthma nurse can review your child\u2019s asthma, update your child\u2019s action plan, and check your child\u2019s inhaler technique.\nYou can ask them about your child\u2019s symptoms, triggers, and any allergies that could be making your child\u2019s symptoms worse.\nIf your child has worsening symptoms or an asthma attack, their GP or asthma nurse should review their treatment plan, and give you advice on how to avoid another asthma attack.\nHelp your child stay fit and healthy\nStaying active\nWhether it\u2019s PE at school, or playing out with friends, keeping active and doing exercise is good for your child, as long as their asthma is well managed.\nEncourage them to be as active as possible with our top tips for keeping a child with asthma active.\nEating healthily\nEating well and maintaining a healthy weight can help your child\u2019s asthma. If your child is overweight their asthma will be harder to manage, and they\u2019ll be more likely to have symptoms like breathlessness.\nFind out more about weight and asthma.\nStop smoking\nSmoking around you child will make their asthma symptoms worse and put them at much higher risk of an asthma attack. Their asthma medicine won\u2019t work as well.\nAsk other people not to smoke around your child too.\nIf you smoke, your GP or pharmacist can give lots of advice about quitting smoking.\nHelp your child to look after their own asthma\nIt\u2019s a good idea to help your child to start looking after their own asthma, even when they\u2019re quite young. It can help your child feel more confident and in control, and give you more peace of mind when your child\u2019s at school or away from home\nEven younger children can start to do small things to look after their asthma, for example:\n\thelping you wash out their spacer\n\tchoosing a good place to keep their preventer inhaler\n\tdecorating a bag or pencil case for their reliever inhaler\n\tusing our asthma calendar and stickers.\nOlder children could:\n\tset a reminder on their phone to take their preventer inhaler\n\tkeep track of symptoms, either using our calendar, or on their phone\n\ttell their friends and teachers about their asthma, and show them their action plan\n\tkeep their action plan somewhere safe, or save it on their phone\n\tthink of questions they want to ask themselves at their asthma review\n\tthink about ways to describe their symptoms so they can tell their GP or asthma nurse\n\twrite down each time they need to use their reliever inhaler\n\twatch our inhaler videos to check their inhaler technique.",

These should not be used as monotherapy due to an FDA black-box warning of the occurrences of severe asthma exacerbations, which in some patients with asthma is associated with death. Furthermore, monotherapy of a long-acting beta-agonist has not been seen to have sufficient benefit of therapy to justify the risk of adverse outcomes. This adverse risk is not seen in combination therapy with anticholinergic or corticosteroid medicines.[6][7]\nSome side effects of beta-agonist medications have been noted to include tremor, increased nervousness and insomnia in children, nausea, fever, bronchospasm, vomiting, headache, pain, dizziness, cough, allergic reaction, dry mouth, sweating, chills, and dyspepsia.",

Write down your symptoms in a diary, notebook, or on your phone and take it along to your next appointment.\nRemember to make a note of anything you were doing that day or any triggers you came across - you may notice you\u2019re sensitive to new things that were not a problem before.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ignore symptoms like breathlessness,\u201d says Dr Andy. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that feeling a bit more breathless is just another sign that you\u2019re not as fit as you used to be.\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re feeling out of breath climbing stairs or walking uphill, see your GP to get it checked out. Breathlessness can be a sign that your asthma is not well controlled. It could also be a sign of another health condition.\u201d\nAct quickly if symptoms get worse\nTo cut your risk of an asthma attack, take action as soon as you notice symptoms getting worse. \u00a0As we get older, asthma attacks can be more severe and take longer to recover from.\nTalk through your asthma action plan with your GP or asthma nurse so you know exactly what you need to do and who you need to call when symptoms flare up.\nCheck your inhaler technique\nIt\u2019s good for everyone to check up on their inhaler technique regularly. Take a look at our inhaler videos and ask your GP or asthma nurse to check how well you\u2019re using your inhalers.\nIf you\u2019re finding it harder to take your inhalers, perhaps due to a condition like arthritis, ask if there\u2019s a different device that might be easier for you.\nAsk about side effects\nSide effects, like palpitations or feeling shaky after using your reliever inhaler, can feel worse as you get older.\nTaking long-term oral steroids (prednisolone tablets) or high doses of inhaled steroids can increase the risk of developing cataracts, osteoporosis, or thinner skin that bruises easily. However, not everyone will experience these side effects.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep taking your asthma medicines,\u201d says Dr Andy, \u201cbut talk to your GP or asthma nurse as soon as possible if you\u2019re worried about any side effects. There are simple things they can help you with, like checking your inhaler technique, or looking at alternative treatments such as LTRAs.\u201d\nGet help for other conditions too\nIt\u2019s common to have more than one long-term condition to deal with as you get older.\nSome of these conditions may have symptoms that overlap. For example, many of the symptoms of asthma are like those of chronic bronchitis or emphysema, which are types of COPD (chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).\nSome other conditions like obstructive sleep apnoea and acid reflux can also make asthma symptoms worse.\nAnd some drugs for other conditions may affect how well your asthma medicines work, or cause tightening in your airways.\n\u201cSpeak with your GP or pharmacist if you\u2019re concerned that any of your medicines are affecting your asthma, or if you think any of your asthma medicines are making you unwell,\u201d says Dr Andy.\u201d\nFind out more about other conditions.\nMeasure your peak flow\nYour GP can check how well you can fill your lungs with air, and how well you can breathe out again, using a peak flow test.\nYou can continue to measure your peak flow at home, using a peak flow diary. Some people find this a helpful way to monitor their asthma.\nAvoid colds and flu\nAsk your GP or asthma nurse for a yearly flu vaccine or a one-off pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia.\nYou can lower your risk of getting a cold or other respiratory infections by washing your hands and staying away from friends or family who have colds.",

Writing down what could be aggravating your asthma can help you and your doctor formulate a new treatment plan.\nConsider recording the following:\ntriggers you may have been exposed to\nchanges to your sleep\nsymptoms, including what occurs and when\nwhen you have to use your rescue inhaler\nwhen asthma symptoms interfere with your daily life, such as at work or school or when exercising\nother health conditions that occur, like allergy or cold-like symptoms\nresults of your peak flow meter measurements. Your doctor may provide a peak flow meter for you to measure the air coming from your lungs.\n\nTreatment options for asthma\nMany types of asthma treatments can be incorporated into your management plan. The goal of treatment is to use as few treatments as possible so you can live with minimal symptoms.\nA good treatment plan will keep your symptoms in check, decrease the chance of your asthma symptoms worsening, and minimize the side effects of asthma medications.\nOne of the most significant ways to treat asthma is to avoid triggers that cause it. Asthma triggers are wide-ranging and can include:\nallergens like pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and mold\nirritants like smoke, chemicals, and pollution\nillnesses\nnot taking prescribed medications\ncold and hot weather\ndamp or humid conditions\nstress\nexercise\nYour doctor may consider several different medications for your asthma depending on your symptoms and their severity.\nAsthma medications include:\ncontroller inhalers for daily maintenance, some of which include corticosteroids or other medications\ncombination inhalers for daily maintenance, which may contain a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta agonist\nrescue inhalers that contain medicines like short-acting beta agonists such as albuterol\noral medications like leukotriene modifiers or steroids\nintravenous steroids for acute or severe asthma\ninjections or infusions containing biologics\nYour doctor may also discuss complementary or alternative therapies, such as stress-reducing methods, breathing exercises, or acupuncture. Many of these therapies lack significant research to prove they can effectively control asthma symptoms. Your doctor may still encourage you to incorporate them into your treatment plan.\nIt\u2019s important to educate yourself about your treatment plan. Follow it closely to minimize symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n\nTalking to your doctor\nYou should meet regularly with your doctor if you have asthma. During your appointment, you\u2019ll get to discuss your symptoms and determine whether your treatment plan is effective. Share the records you keep of your symptoms with your doctor so they can get a clear idea of how your management plan is working.\nYour doctor may recommend a few in-office tests to measure your airways. One of these is called a spirometry test. This test measures the amount of air your lungs can let out and how fast the air is let out after a deep breath.\nAdjusting your treatment plan doesn\u2019t always mean more interventions. Well-controlled asthma may be a sign that you can reduce the medications in your treatment plan. You may also find that your plan needs seasonal adjustments depending on how you react to certain triggers.\nWorking with a new treatment plan\nYou likely have questions or concerns about starting a new treatment plan. They may be about managing numerous medications, budgeting for the costs of the treatment plan, or preparing for an asthma attack. Make sure to discuss them with your doctor at your appointment.\nWrite down the details of your new treatment plan to make it easier to follow. Your treatment plan may involve a few different medications, so it\u2019s important to use them correctly.\nContact your doctor if you feel confused about the new treatment plan. Your doctor can review what you need to do and answer any questions that come up once you begin.\nTakeaway\nYour asthma treatment plan should be able to control most of your symptoms. But your asthma can change over time, prompting the need for a new plan.\nRecord your daily symptoms and share them with your doctor to determine how to control your condition. Finding the perfect plan may take some time and effort, but it\u2019s worth it so you can achieve a better quality of life.\n\n",

In addition, you may commonly experience nighttime flare-ups and may even have to visit the emergency room. As you might expect, with these symptoms you may miss work, stop exercising, and have difficulty performing daily tasks. If you have signs of uncontrolled asthma as listed above, you will want to discuss this with you physician because you may be able to find a solution.\nIf you have mild to moderate asthma with uncontrolled symptoms, you may potentially be better controlled with adjustments to your treatment plan. Your doctor will want to evaluate the effectiveness of your current medication, as well as assess current lung function and determine your common triggers. This can be done by keeping an asthma diary or answering an asthma symptoms questionnaire. You may need to have a spirometry test, which is a simple, noninvasive breathing test to assess your current lung function.",

Studies about the association in our country are very scanty. Therefore, we undertook this study considering the public health importance of this issue and the severe paucity of literature on the subject in our country. We examined the effect of breastfeeding on the risk of developing childhood asthma and its severity (as measured by the peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR] levels) among children aged 6-12 years. The evaluating parameters among breastfeeding were the duration and type of breastfeeding (exclusive vs. non-exclusive).",

The investigators also aim to define the activity levels of asthma-associated gene networks that correspond to specific health outcomes during antibody treatment in these children, most of whom are anticipated to be Black or Hispanic. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, is sponsoring and co-funding the trial, called Prevention of Asthma Exacerbations Using Dupilumab in Urban Children and Adolescents, or PANDA.\nDupilumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an add-on maintenance treatment for certain types of moderate-to-severe asthma in people ages 6 years and older. However, little data exist on the effectiveness of the drug in Black and Hispanic children, even though severe asthma disproportionately affects U.S. children in these racial and ethnic groups. The new NIAID study will help fill this knowledge gap.\n",

Once you have developed sensitive airways, your respiratory tract tends to stay sensitive to asthma triggers for life. That doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll always be bothered by your asthma. But it does mean that if you had it as a child, even if you seem to have \u201coutgrown\u201d the condition, you very well may experience symptoms again as an adult.\n",
